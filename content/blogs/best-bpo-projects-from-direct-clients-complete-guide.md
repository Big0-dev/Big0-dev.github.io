## Pricing Direct Client Projects

Direct relationships give you pricing power. Use it wisely.

### Value-Based Pricing

Don't price based on your costs. Price based on value delivered.

**Example:**
- If you'll save a client $500,000 annually through process improvement
- Pricing at $150,000 annually is a bargain for them and profitable for you
- Both parties win, creating a sustainable relationship

### Pricing Models for Direct Clients

**Fixed Price:**

## Building Long-Term Direct Client Relationships

Landing the first project is just the beginning. The real value is in long-term relationships.

### Deliver Exceptional Results

Nothing builds relationships like results. Focus on:
- Meeting or exceeding all committed metrics
- Proactive communication about progress and issues
- Continuous improvement suggestions
- Going above and beyond on important moments

### Expand the Relationship

Happy clients often have more needs than they initially share.

**Expansion strategies:**
- Regular business reviews to understand evolving needs
- Propose pilot projects for adjacent services
- Connect with other departments and divisions
- Offer volume discounts for expanded scope

### Protect the Relationship

Long-term relationships require ongoing attention.

**Relationship maintenance:**
- Regular executive-level touchpoints

- Recognition of key client milestones

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Underpricing to Win

Racing to the bottom destroys margins and often signals desperation. Direct clients expect to pay fair rates for quality service.

### Over-Promising

It's tempting to promise everything to close a deal. But under-delivering destroys trust faster than anything else.

### Neglecting Existing Clients

The excitement of new business shouldn't distract from serving current clients. Retention is more profitable than acquisition.

### Failing to Document Value

If you can't prove the value you deliver, you're vulnerable at renewal time. Track and communicate results consistently.
