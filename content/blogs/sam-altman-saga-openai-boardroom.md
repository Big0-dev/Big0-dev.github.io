On Friday, November 17, 2023, the most powerful AI company in the world fired its CEO without warning.

By the following Wednesday, he was back - and most of the board was gone.

In between: the strangest five days in technology history. A story of power, ideology, governance, and the question of who controls the most consequential technology of our time.

## Friday: The Firing

### What Happened

At 12:23 PM Pacific, OpenAI's board published a terse statement: Sam Altman was out, effective immediately. The reason given: he "was not consistently candid in his communications with the board."

No specifics. No warning to investors, partners, or employees. The world learned via blog post.

### The Immediate Shock

**Microsoft's reaction:** They found out minutes before the announcement. They'd invested $13 billion in OpenAI. Nobody called.

**Employee reaction:** Mass confusion. Slack channels exploded. Nobody knew what happened.

**Industry reaction:** If the CEO of OpenAI can be fired without warning, what did he do? Speculation ranged from safety violations to fraud to AGI achievement.

### The Board's Reasoning

The four board members who voted to remove Altman:
- Ilya Sutskever (Chief Scientist, co-founder)
- Adam D'Angelo (CEO of Quora)
- Tasha McCauley (CEO of Fellow Robots)
- Helen Toner (AI policy researcher)

They later said: their concern was about trust and candor, not a single incident. They felt Altman had systematically undermined the board's ability to govern.

What specifically? Never publicly disclosed. Speculation included: undisclosed business dealings, safety disagreements, power consolidation.

## Saturday-Sunday: The Chaos

### The Negotiation Attempts

**Saturday morning:** Investors, led by Thrive Capital and Tiger Global, pressured the board to reverse course. The board refused.

**Saturday afternoon:** Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called board members directly. The board held firm.

**Saturday night:** OpenAI named Twitch's Emmett Shear as interim CEO - a surprise choice who hadn't even joined the company.

**Sunday:** Negotiations for Altman's return began. The board demanded governance changes. Altman demanded board changes.

### The Employee Revolt

**The petition:** Over 700 of OpenAI's 770 employees signed a letter threatening to resign unless the board stepped down and Altman returned.

**The leverage:** These weren't just workers. They were the researchers, engineers, and scientists who built GPT-4. If they left, OpenAI's value would collapse.

**The unprecedented solidarity:** Even employees who might have agreed with the board's concerns signed. The process, not the substance, was the breaking point.

## Monday: The Microsoft Move

### The Offer

Satya Nadella announced that Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman would join Microsoft to lead a new AI research team - with resources to hire any OpenAI employee who wanted to follow.

**The subtext:** If OpenAI's board wanted to destroy the company, Microsoft would simply absorb the pieces.

**The pressure:** This gave OpenAI employees a path out that preserved their compensation. And it showed the board they couldn't win.

## Tuesday-Wednesday: The Resolution

### The Deal

**Altman returned as CEO.** His primary condition was a reconstituted board.

**The old board dissolved.** Sutskever, McCauley, and Toner stepped down. D'Angelo stayed initially.

**New board members:** Bret Taylor (former Salesforce CEO) as chair, Larry Summers (former Treasury Secretary), and eventually others chosen by Altman.

**The power shift:** The new board was friendly to Altman. The independent oversight that caused the crisis was replaced with allies.

### Ilya's Reversal

Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's co-founder and chief scientist, had voted to fire Altman. By Sunday, he'd signed the employee letter saying he regretted his role.

**What changed?** He later said he still believed in the governance concerns but didn't anticipate the chaos his vote would cause.

**The interpretation:** Either he was pressured into recanting, or he genuinely concluded the process was wrong even if the concerns were right.

**The departure:** Sutskever left OpenAI months later to start a new company focused on AI safety.

## The Governance Questions

### What the Saga Revealed

**The nonprofit structure was theater.** OpenAI was structured as a nonprofit with a capped-profit subsidiary. This was supposed to ensure mission over money. In practice, the $100+ billion valuation meant market forces dominated.

**The board lacked power.** A board that can fire the CEO but can't survive doing so isn't really in control. The employees and investors held the real power.

**Safety concerns can't survive commercial pressure.** If Toner and McCauley did have legitimate safety concerns, the structure provided no way to act on them without destroying the organization.

### The Competing Narratives

**The Altman narrative:** Rogue board members, possibly influenced by competitors or ideologues, tried to destroy a company for unclear reasons. The employees and market corrected the mistake.

**The board narrative:** Altman had concentrated too much power and was not transparent with the body meant to oversee him. Firing was appropriate; the inability to make it stick was a governance failure, not a validation.

**The safety narrative:** This was about AI development pace and safety concerns. The board worried Altman was moving too fast. Altman's return meant those concerns would be ignored.

**The truth:** Probably elements of all three. The full story may never be public.

## The Aftermath

### At OpenAI

**Power consolidated.** Altman emerged with more control than before. The board that challenged him was gone.

**Commercial acceleration.** GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 Vision, and eventually GPT-5 shipped without the friction a skeptical board might have provided.

**Talent departures.** Several key researchers left, some citing the governance chaos, some the shift in culture.

### For the Industry

**The lesson for boards:** Don't fire the founder unless you're absolutely certain you can survive the aftermath.

**The lesson for founders:** Governance structures only matter if they have teeth. OpenAI's didn't.

**The lesson for society:** The organizations building the most powerful technology have weak oversight mechanisms. The market favors speed over caution.

### For AI Safety

**The concern:** If a board that tried to enforce safety considerations couldn't survive the attempt, what does that mean for AI governance generally?

**The hope:** The incident sparked broader conversation about AI governance. Maybe it will lead to better structures - external regulation, different organizational models.

**The reality:** Most AI companies doubled down on commercial structures without even the pretense of nonprofit oversight.

## What It Means

### For Believers in Corporate Governance

**The lesson:** Governance works when there's alignment or when there are enforcement mechanisms. At OpenAI, neither existed.

**The question:** Can any corporate structure provide meaningful oversight of transformational technology when commercial interests are this large?

### For Believers in AI Safety

**The concern:** The organizations building frontier AI are governed by the people building frontier AI. External oversight is weak or absent.

**The hope:** Maybe governments will step in. Maybe new organizational structures will emerge. Maybe the market will somehow reward caution.

**The realism:** Don't count on it.

### For Everyone Else

**The observation:** The technology shaping our future is being built by organizations with significant governance weaknesses. The November 2023 saga made this visible.

**The question:** What should be done about it?
