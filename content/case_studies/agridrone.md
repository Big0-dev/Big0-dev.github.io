## The Market Problem

Pakistani farmers face a painful choice. Manual pesticide spraying exposes workers to toxic chemicals, wastes product through poor coverage, and delivers inconsistent results. But commercial precision spraying drones cost $6,000-$10,000—completely out of reach for most agricultural operations.

The global agricultural drone market is growing rapidly, but that growth isn't reaching the farmers who need it most. International drones are designed for American and European farms—large budgets, different crops, different scales. Pakistani farmers are stuck with methods that are dangerous, inefficient, and increasingly uncompetitive.

## The Solution

Big0's research team, led by Hassan Kamran (ORCID: 0009-0005-3034-1679), developed a precision agricultural drone that delivers commercial performance at a price Pakistani farmers can afford.

The system uses simulation-driven development—virtually testing airframe configurations, motor combinations, and spray patterns before physical construction—to optimize both performance and cost simultaneously. The result: an 8-motor octocopter with extended flight time, adequate spray capacity, and precision application that puts chemicals exactly where they're needed.

Anti-drift nozzle design keeps spray on target even in moderate wind conditions. GPS navigation plans flight paths for uniform coverage across irregularly shaped fields. The modular construction enables maintenance and component replacement without specialized tools or expertise—critical for adoption in rural areas without access to technical support.

## The Results

Field testing validated performance across diverse Pakistani agricultural conditions:

- **Spraying speed**: 7.5 minutes per acre versus 16 minutes manually — 53% faster
- **Water usage**: 10 liters per acre versus 59 liters manually — 84% reduction through precision application
- **System cost**: approximately $3,500 versus $8,500+ for commercial alternatives — 65% savings
- **Payback period**: within 1.5 years for operations of 200+ acres

The drone eliminates direct operator exposure to harmful chemicals while delivering spray uniformity that manual methods can't match. Coverage is consistent across the entire field rather than degrading as laborers tire through a long day.

The project demonstrates that precision agricultural technology can be made accessible without compromising performance. The approach—simulation-driven development, cost-optimized engineering, locally sourceable components—provides a template for similar markets across South Asia and Africa where the same cost barriers exist.

The research was published in IEEE, validating the engineering approach through independent peer review.
