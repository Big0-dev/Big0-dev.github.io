## The Market Problem

Pakistani farmers face a painful choice. Manual pesticide spraying exposes workers to toxic chemicals, wastes product through poor coverage, and delivers inconsistent results. But commercial precision spraying drones cost $6,000-$10,000—completely out of reach for most agricultural operations.

The global agricultural drone market is growing rapidly, but that growth isn't reaching the farmers who need it most. They're stuck with methods that are dangerous, inefficient, and increasingly uncompetitive.

## The Solution

Big0's research team, led by Hassan Kamran (ORCID: 0009-0005-3034-1679), developed a precision agricultural drone that delivers commercial performance at a price Pakistani farmers can actually afford.

The system uses simulation-driven development—virtually testing configurations before physical construction—to optimize both performance and cost. The result: an 8-motor drone with extended flight time, spray capacity, and precision application that puts chemicals exactly where they're needed.

Anti-drift nozzle design keeps spray on target. The modular construction enables easy maintenance and component replacement without specialized tools or expertise.

## The Results

Field testing validated performance across diverse Pakistani agricultural conditions. The system eliminates direct operator exposure to harmful chemicals while delivering spray accuracy that manual methods can't match.

Coverage is faster and more uniform. Water and chemical usage drops dramatically through precision application. And at roughly $3,500, the economics work for operations that could never justify commercial drone prices.

The project demonstrates that advanced agricultural technology can be made accessible without compromising performance. The approach—simulation-driven development, cost-optimized engineering, local manufacturing considerations—provides a template for democratizing precision agriculture throughout South Asia and similar markets.
