## The Business Challenge

Property conveyancing requires reviewing extensive document bundles for every transaction—title registers, leases, transfer forms, and supporting documents. For each bundle, experienced solicitors must identify what's missing, determine what enquiries to raise, and flag legal risks that could affect the transaction.

This work is essential but repetitive. It consumes significant solicitor time, creates bottlenecks during busy periods, and limits how many transactions a firm can handle. Our client, a London-based legal services company, wanted to change this equation—scaling their capacity without proportionally growing headcount, while maintaining the quality their clients expect.

They needed a tool that could match the accuracy of experienced conveyancers, not a "good enough" approximation that would require extensive human review anyway.

## The Solution

Big0 built an AI-powered platform that analyzes property document bundles and produces comprehensive reports matching the quality of experienced solicitors.

The system accepts document bundles in any format and produces structured reports covering:

- **Missing Documents**: What's absent from the bundle that should be there
- **Standard Enquiries**: Questions to raise based on what the documents reveal
- **Legal Risks**: Issues requiring attention—consent requirements, short leases, easements, restrictive covenants, title defects

Every finding is traced back to specific pages in the source documents. When the system isn't confident about something, it says so explicitly rather than guessing—because in legal work, a confident wrong answer is worse than an acknowledged uncertainty.

## Validation & Quality

The platform was validated against 50 real transaction bundles, with the client's own reports serving as the benchmark. The system had to match what experienced conveyancers would produce—not just in format, but in substance.

The quality bar was strict: miss too many issues, and the tool isn't trustworthy. Flag too many false positives, and solicitors waste time checking non-issues. The system met the bar across missing documents, enquiries, and risk identification.

## The Results

Document bundles that previously took hours to review are now processed in minutes. Solicitors focus on judgment calls and client communication rather than systematic document review.

Every bundle receives the same thorough analysis, regardless of workload pressure or staff availability. The platform serves multiple law firms while keeping each firm's data strictly isolated, with all processing in UK data centers.

The platform transforms property conveyancing from a capacity-constrained, labor-intensive process into a scalable operation. Law firms can handle more transactions with existing staff, deliver faster turnaround to clients, and maintain consistent quality across every matter.
