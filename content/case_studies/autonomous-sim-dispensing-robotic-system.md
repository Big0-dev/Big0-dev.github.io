## The Business Problem

Telecommunications providers wanted to offer 24/7 SIM card sales through unmanned retail kiosks. The challenge: SIM cards are tiny and delicate. Pick them up wrong and they're damaged. Position them incorrectly and the dispenser jams. Miss by a fraction of a millimeter and the whole transaction fails.

Existing automation solutions couldn't deliver the precision required. Traditional robotic systems were either too imprecise, too bulky, or couldn't handle the temperature variations of outdoor retail environments. The providers needed a purpose-built solution that could operate reliably, continuously, and without human oversight.

## The Solution

Big0 developed a custom robotic arm specifically engineered for precision handling of small retail items.

The system achieves sub-millimeter precision that ensures reliable SIM card handling without damage. An integrated camera system provides real-time quality control and inventory monitoring, verifying each transaction and detecting any anomalies automatically.

_Production-ready system for retail deployment_

Telecommunications providers can now offer SIM cards anywhere, anytime—airports, shopping centers, transit stations—without staffing costs or limited hours. Customers get instant service. Providers get expanded reach with minimal operational overhead.

The modular platform has applications beyond SIM dispensing. Any retail scenario requiring precision handling of small items—electronics accessories, pharmaceuticals, high-value components—can leverage the same approach.
