## The Market Problem

Traditional earbuds create a dangerous tradeoff for professionals. Healthcare workers, security personnel, and athletes need hands-free communication—but blocking environmental sounds puts them and others at risk.

Existing bone conduction alternatives weren't the answer. Bulky designs looked unprofessional. Audio quality couldn't match traditional solutions. Battery life didn't last full work shifts. The market needed a bone conduction product that could actually compete on quality while solving the safety and comfort problems.
