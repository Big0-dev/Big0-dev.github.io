## The Business Problem

A global rental solutions provider was losing money on missed orders. Operating across 50+ countries—from Singapore to Australia, the UK, and the US—they serve corporate events, conferences, and business setups. But their operations teams were flying blind.

The legacy rental software provided no visibility into order status across locations. Depot managers in different time zones couldn't coordinate effectively. Orders were falling through the cracks, handovers were being missed, and delays were translating directly into lost revenue and damaged client relationships.

Leadership couldn't answer basic questions: How many orders are at risk today? Which depots are bottlenecked? Where are the handover failures happening?

## The Solution

Big0 built a real-time operations dashboard that unified visibility across all country operations.

The dashboard provides a single view of every order's status—from initial request through delivery and return. Interactive Kanban boards let operations staff see exactly where each order sits in the lifecycle. Intelligent alerts flag stuck orders before they become problems, and staff can dynamically reprioritize workloads as situations change.

We integrated directly with their existing rental software, pulling data in real-time despite minimal documentation and limited API support from the vendor. The system captures inter-departmental discussions alongside order data, so teams have full context on why delays happen and what's been done about them.

## The Results

The transformation was immediate. Missed orders—previously a constant drain on revenue and client relationships—virtually disappeared. Operations teams stopped firefighting and started preventing problems before they escalated.

Depot managers, operations staff, and executives now work from the same real-time picture. Coordination that used to require phone calls and emails happens naturally because everyone can see what's happening.

What started as a visibility problem became an operational command center. The company can now scale into new markets without proportionally increasing operational overhead—they can handle more volume with the same team because everyone can see what matters and act on it.
