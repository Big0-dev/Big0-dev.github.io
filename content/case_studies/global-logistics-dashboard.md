## The Business Problem

A global rental solutions provider was losing money on missed orders. Operating across 50+ countries—from Singapore to Australia, the UK, and the US—they serve corporate events, conferences, and business setups. But their operations teams were flying blind.

The legacy rental software provided no visibility into order status across locations. Depot managers in different time zones couldn't coordinate effectively. Orders were falling through the cracks, handovers were being missed, and delays were translating directly into lost revenue and damaged client relationships.

Leadership couldn't answer basic questions: How many orders are at risk today? Which depots are bottlenecked? Where are the handover failures happening?

## The Solution

Big0 built a real-time operations dashboard that unified visibility across all country operations.

The dashboard provides a single view of every order's status—from initial request through delivery and return. Interactive Kanban boards let operations staff see exactly where each order sits in the lifecycle. Intelligent alerts flag stuck orders before they become problems, and staff can dynamically reprioritize workloads as situations change.

We integrated directly with their existing rental software, pulling data in real-time despite minimal documentation and limited API support from the vendor. Reverse-engineering the data model and building reliable extraction pipelines was a significant engineering challenge—but it meant the client didn't need to replace their core system.

The dashboard captures inter-departmental discussions alongside order data, so teams have full context on why delays happen and what's been done about them. When a depot manager in Singapore flags an issue, the team in London sees it immediately with full history.

## The Results

The transformation was immediate. Missed orders—previously a constant drain on revenue and client relationships—stopped. Operations teams shifted from reactive firefighting to proactive prevention because they could see problems developing before they escalated.

Depot managers, operations staff, and executives now work from the same real-time picture. Coordination that used to require phone calls and emails across time zones happens naturally because everyone can see what's happening.

What started as a visibility problem became an operational command center. The company can scale into new markets without proportionally increasing operational overhead—they handle more volume with the same team because everyone can see what matters and act on it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can a global operations dashboard help multinational companies?
A global operations dashboard centralizes data from disparate systems across countries, allowing teams to monitor orders, inventory, and logistics from a single interface. This eliminates information silos and helps identify bottlenecks instantly, preventing revenue loss from missed orders and improving response times across time zones.

### What challenges do companies face with legacy rental systems?
Legacy rental systems often create data silos that prevent a unified view of global operations. They lack real-time integration, making it impossible to track inventory across multiple countries simultaneously. Operations teams lack accurate data, leading to poor decision-making, inefficient resource allocation, and frustrated customers.

### Why is real-time visibility critical for global logistics?
Real-time visibility prevents revenue loss that occurs when teams lack current information. For companies operating across multiple continents, seeing operations in Singapore, Australia, the UK, and the US simultaneously enables proactive management rather than reactive firefighting. Live data means problems are caught before they impact customers.

### How does a dashboard improve decision-making for rental operations?
A dashboard aggregates critical metrics into one accessible location. Instead of manually compiling reports from different systems, managers instantly see order status, inventory levels, and regional performance. This enables faster resource allocation, equipment rerouting, and demand anticipation.
