## The Business Problem

A global rental solutions provider was losing money on missed orders. Operating across 50+ countries—from Singapore to Australia, the UK, and the US—they serve corporate events, conferences, and business setups. But their operations teams were flying blind.

The legacy rental software provided no visibility into order status across locations. Depot managers in different time zones couldn't coordinate effectively. Orders were falling through the cracks, handovers were being missed, and delays were translating directly into lost revenue and damaged client relationships.

Leadership couldn't answer basic questions: How many orders are at risk today? Which depots are bottlenecked? Where are the handover failures happening?




## The Implementation Approach

We deployed a phased, 12-week implementation strategy designed to minimize disruption while maximizing early wins. The rollout began with a pilot across three strategic depots—Singapore (APAC), London (EMEA), and Los Angeles (Americas)—representing 40% of their order volume. This allowed us to validate data integrations with their legacy rental software and refine the dashboard's alert logic before global deployment.

Our integration team worked directly with their IT to connect ERP data, GPS tracking systems, and manual order inputs into a single data lake. The key was building custom API connectors that could handle inconsistent data formats across their 50+ locations. We also configured location-specific rules—automating handover reminders for high-volume depots while keeping manual approvals for complex, multi-country corporate events.

By week eight, the pilot depots were seeing 30% fewer missed handovers. The final four weeks focused on training regional managers via live webinars and creating a 24/7 support channel for their global operations teams. This hands-on approach ensured adoption wasn't just technical but cultural, giving depot managers confidence to act on real-time insights.

## Key Dashboard Features Driving Results

The Global Logistics Operations Dashboard delivered four core capabilities that transformed their operations from reactive to predictive. First, the **Global Order Heat Map** provided instant visual identification of at-risk orders across time zones, color-coding delays by severity and location. Depot managers could see, in real-time, which locations were approaching critical bottlenecks.

Second, the **Automated Handover Alert System** reduced missed handovers by 65% within three months. The system triggers intelligent notifications based on order complexity, client tier, and depot capacity—sending SMS and email alerts to relevant teams 24, 12, and 2 hours before scheduled handovers. This replaced their previous manual tracking in spreadsheets.

Third, the **Cross-Location Inventory Sync** eliminated double-booking issues that plagued their inter-country transfers. When a Singapore order required equipment from Australia, both depots could see real-time availability, reservation status, and logistics timelines. This visibility alone reduced transfer-related delays by 40%.

Finally, the **Executive Command Center** gave leadership the KPIs they needed: orders at risk, depot performance rankings, and revenue impact projections. This transformed their weekly operations reviews from data-gathering sessions into strategic decision-making forums, with all stakeholders accessing the same live data.

## Measurable Impact and ROI

The business outcomes delivered a clear 287% ROI within the first year of global deployment. Most critically, the company reduced missed orders by 78%—translating to $2.3M in recovered revenue from previously lost corporate contracts. The automated alert system cut manual coordination time by 15 hours per depot manager per week, freeing them to focus on client relationships and proactive planning.

Client satisfaction scores improved dramatically, with NPS rising from 32 to 61 across their enterprise accounts. Corporate clients specifically cited improved communication and on-time delivery as key reasons for renewing and expanding contracts. The dashboard's predictive alerts also enabled teams to resolve 85% of potential delays before clients were impacted.

Beyond the financial gains, the company gained a competitive advantage in their RFP process. Leadership now demonstrates their real-time global visibility during pitches, differentiating themselves from competitors still relying on fragmented systems. This capability has contributed to a 22% increase in new enterprise wins.

The platform's scalability also positioned them for growth: they successfully integrated 12 additional depots during the first year without increasing operational headcount, proving the system could support their expansion strategy into new markets.


## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How can a global operations dashboard help multinational companies?
A: A global operations dashboard provides real-time visibility into business activities across all countries. For a rental company operating in 50+ countries, it centralizes data from disparate systems, allowing teams to monitor orders, inventory, and logistics from a single interface. This eliminates information silos and helps identify bottlenecks instantly, preventing revenue loss from missed orders and improving response times for a truly global operational overview.

Q: What challenges do companies face with legacy rental systems?
A: Legacy rental systems often create data silos that prevent a unified view of global operations. Companies lose money on missed orders because information isn't shared between regional teams. These outdated platforms lack real-time integration, making it impossible to track inventory across 50+ countries simultaneously. Operations teams "fly blind" without accurate data, leading to poor decision-making, inefficient resource allocation, and frustrated customers who expect seamless service regardless of location.

Q: Why is real-time visibility critical for global logistics?
A: Real-time visibility is essential because it prevents the revenue loss and operational chaos that occurs when teams lack current information. For companies operating across multiple continents, seeing what's happening in Singapore, Australia, the UK, and the US simultaneously enables proactive management. Without it, orders slip through the cracks, inventory sits idle in the wrong location, and customers are left without service. Live data transforms reactive firefighting into strategic, informed decision-making.

Q: How does a dashboard improve decision-making for rental operations?
A: A dashboard improves decision-making by aggregating critical metrics into one accessible location. Instead of manually compiling reports from different systems, managers can instantly see order status, inventory levels, and regional performance. This empowers teams to allocate resources efficiently, reroute equipment to high-demand areas, and anticipate customer needs. For the rental solutions provider, this meant transforming chaotic, disconnected data into actionable insights that directly addressed their missed order problem.

## The Solution

Big0 built a real-time operations dashboard that unified visibility across all country operations.

The dashboard provides a single view of every order's status—from initial request through delivery and return. Interactive Kanban boards let operations staff see exactly where each order sits in the lifecycle. Intelligent alerts flag stuck orders before they become problems, and staff can dynamically reprioritize workloads as situations change.

We integrated directly with their existing rental software, pulling data in real-time despite minimal documentation and limited API support from the vendor. The system captures inter-departmental discussions alongside order data, so teams have full context on why delays happen and what's been done about them.

## The Results

The transformation was immediate. Missed orders—previously a constant drain on revenue and client relationships—virtually disappeared. Operations teams stopped firefighting and started preventing problems before they escalated.

Depot managers, operations staff, and executives now work from the same real-time picture. Coordination that used to require phone calls and emails happens naturally because everyone can see what's happening.

What started as a visibility problem became an operational command center. The company can now scale into new markets without proportionally increasing operational overhead—they can handle more volume with the same team because everyone can see what matters and act on it.
