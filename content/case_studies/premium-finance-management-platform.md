## The Business Problem

A growing insurance premium financing company was hitting a wall. They help policyholders spread insurance payments over time—a straightforward business model that was drowning in manual processes.

Calculating amortization schedules meant spreadsheets. Credit assessments required days of back-and-forth. Payment tracking was error-prone. Document collection and signatures created compliance risks and bottlenecks. And leadership had limited visibility into portfolio performance—making it difficult to identify trends, assess risk exposure, or plan strategically.

The manual approach couldn't scale. Every new customer meant more administrative burden, not just more revenue.

## The Solution

Big0 built a complete platform that automates the premium financing lifecycle from quote to payoff.

Credit assessments that previously took days now happen during the quote process. The system pulls credit data in real-time, adjusts terms based on risk, and routes decisions through approval workflows automatically.

Complex amortization schedules are calculated instantly. Multiple payment methods—ACH, checks, cash—reconcile automatically. Financing agreements generate with personalized terms and collect signatures electronically.

Real-time dashboards show policyholder behavior, financing trends, and agency performance. Leadership can see portfolio health at a glance and spot opportunities or risks as they emerge.

## The Results

The platform transformed premium financing from an administrative burden into a scalable operation. What used to take days now takes hours. What used to require manual tracking now happens automatically.

The company can grow transaction volume without proportional increases in staff. Underwriters focus on edge cases that need human judgment rather than routine processing. Leadership makes decisions with real-time data instead of waiting for monthly reports.

Most importantly, the foundation is built. As the company grows, the platform grows with them—without the manual processes that were limiting their potential.
