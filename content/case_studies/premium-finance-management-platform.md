## The Business Problem

A growing insurance premium financing company was hitting a wall. They help policyholders spread insurance payments over time—a straightforward business model that was drowning in manual processes.

Calculating amortization schedules meant spreadsheets. Credit assessments required days of back-and-forth between underwriters, credit bureaus, and approvers. Payment tracking across ACH, checks, and cash was error-prone and labor-intensive. Document collection and e-signatures created compliance bottlenecks. And leadership had no real-time view of portfolio performance—making it difficult to identify trends, assess risk exposure, or plan strategically.

Every new customer meant more administrative burden. The manual approach couldn't scale.

## The Solution

Big0 built a platform that automates the premium financing lifecycle from quote to payoff.

**Credit assessment moved inline.** What previously required days of manual processing now happens during the quoting process. The system pulls credit data in real-time, calculates risk-adjusted terms, and routes decisions through approval workflows automatically. Underwriters focus on edge cases that need human judgment rather than routine applications.

**Amortization and payments are handled automatically.** Complex schedules calculate instantly based on policy terms. Multiple payment methods—ACH, checks, cash—reconcile without manual data entry. The system flags missed payments and triggers follow-up workflows before accounts become problematic.

**Document management is integrated end-to-end.** Financing agreements generate with personalized terms based on the approved quote. E-signatures collect without printing, scanning, or mailing. All documents attach to the customer record automatically, creating a complete audit trail.

**Portfolio analytics give leadership visibility.** Real-time dashboards show policyholder payment behavior, financing trends by product type, and agency performance. Leadership sees portfolio health at a glance and spots opportunities or risks as they emerge rather than waiting for monthly reports compiled manually.

## The Results

The platform transformed premium financing from an administrative burden into a scalable operation. The company processes new applications in the same day rather than over multiple days. Payment reconciliation that consumed hours of staff time each week happens automatically.

The company can grow transaction volume without proportional increases in administrative staff. Underwriters spend their time on decisions that require judgment. Leadership makes strategic decisions with current data.

The integrated approach also reduced errors at handoff points. When credit assessment flows directly into document generation and payment scheduling, there are fewer opportunities for data to be entered incorrectly or documents to go missing between steps.
