## The Business Problem

Real estate investing has an information asymmetry. Large investment firms have dedicated research teams, proprietary data feeds, and sophisticated analytics. Individual investors and smaller firms are stuck with fragmented data from dozens of sources, basic tools, and manual analysis.

Retail investors spend hours pulling data from Zillow, Realtor.com, Census records, and labor statistics—compiling it into spreadsheets that go stale immediately. They make decisions with incomplete information. They miss opportunities that better-equipped competitors capture.

## The Solution

Big0 built an analytics platform that aggregates data from dozens of public and private sources into a unified view.

Instead of manually pulling from multiple sites, investors see everything in one place. The aggregation pipeline normalizes data from sources with different formats, update frequencies, and geographic coverage into a consistent, queryable dataset.

**Analytics calculate the metrics serious investors need:** cap rates, cash-on-cash returns, market appreciation trends. The platform does the math that investors would otherwise handle in spreadsheets—but across entire markets rather than individual properties.

**Interactive maps** show property values, rental yields, market activity, and demographic patterns across any geographic area. Investors can zoom from national trends down to neighborhood-level data. Geospatial overlays reveal patterns that spreadsheets can't surface—like how proximity to transit or school districts correlates with rental demand.

**Predictive models** identify emerging opportunities and assess investment risk based on historical patterns and current market signals.

A freemium model makes the platform accessible. The free tier provides enough value to demonstrate the product, while premium tiers unlock advanced features for investors willing to pay for deeper analysis.

## The Results

The platform found product-market fit with organic adoption through the free tier converting to paid subscriptions. Investors use it to identify opportunities across markets they wouldn't have analyzed manually, compare properties with consistent metrics, and make faster decisions backed by aggregated data.

Sub-second query performance across large datasets means investors can explore interactively rather than waiting for reports to generate. The geospatial interface surfaces patterns that tabular data misses—making it easier to spot emerging neighborhoods and undervalued markets.

The approach—taking analytical capabilities previously reserved for institutional research teams and making them accessible through engineering—applies across financial services wherever information asymmetry creates an opportunity.
