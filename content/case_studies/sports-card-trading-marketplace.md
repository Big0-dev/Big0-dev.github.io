## The Business Problem

The sports card collecting market has a trust problem. Collectors want to trade valuable cards—sometimes worth thousands of dollars—but existing options are risky. How do you trade 3 Luka Dončić Silver Prizm PSA 10 cards for 3 Zion Williamson Silver PSA 10 cards plus $2,000 cash with a stranger on the internet?

Counterfeits are everywhere. Condition disputes kill deals. And without a trusted intermediary, high-value trades either don't happen or end badly. Collectors were stuck choosing between avoiding the trades they wanted or taking substantial financial risks on informal deals.



## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is a sports card trading marketplace?
A: A sports card trading marketplace is a secure online platform where collectors can buy, sell, and trade sports cards with other users. Unlike standard auctions, these marketplaces often facilitate direct swaps, like trading a Luka Dončić card for a Zion Williamson card. They provide tools for verifying authenticity and managing complex transactions, solving the trust problem inherent in high-value card exchanges.

Q: How do you trade sports cards safely?
A: To trade sports cards safely, use a dedicated marketplace that offers escrow services and authentication verification. This protects both parties by holding cards and funds until the trade is confirmed. Always verify the condition and grade of cards, such as PSA 10 ratings, before finalizing. A secure platform eliminates the risks of scams and ensures a fair exchange for valuable items like Silver Prizm cards.

Q: What is the best platform for high-value card trading?
A: The best platform for high-value card trading is one that prioritizes security, authentication, and user trust. Look for marketplaces that specialize in graded cards (PSA, BGS) and offer features like trade escrow and dispute resolution. These platforms solve the liquidity problem by connecting serious collectors, making it easier to swap premium assets like Luka Dončić Silver Prizms without the risks of private sales.

Q: Why is there a trust problem in sports card collecting?
A: The sports card market has a trust problem due to the prevalence of counterfeits, condition issues, and scams in private transactions. High-value cards, such as PSA 10 graded rookies, can be worth thousands, making buyers wary. Without a neutral third party, disputes over authenticity or payment are common. Marketplaces solve this by providing verification and secure transaction methods for collectors.

Q: How do marketplaces solve the liquidity problem for collectors?
A: Marketplaces solve the liquidity problem for collectors by creating a centralized hub of active buyers and traders. Instead of searching for a specific trade partner privately, you can list your cards and connect with interested parties instantly. This is crucial for high-value swaps, like trading multiple PSA 10 cards for cash or other players, turning illiquid assets into tradable value more efficiently.

## The Solution

Big0 built a marketplace that makes complex trades safe and simple.

The key innovation: both parties ship their items to a central verification hub staffed by professional authenticators. Every card is verified for authenticity, condition, and specifications before any exchange happens. Cash components are held in secure escrow. Only after everything checks out does the trade complete.

The platform supports the complex trades collectors actually want to make—multiple cards on each side, cash to balance values, detailed negotiations. Real-time messaging keeps both parties informed throughout. And comprehensive tracking provides complete chain of custody from shipment to delivery.

For collectors, it means they can finally make the trades they've been avoiding. For the market, it means more liquidity and better price discovery.

## The Results

The marketplace created something new in the collectibles space: a way to make high-value trades with complete strangers safely. Since launch, not a single fraudulent transaction has completed—the verification process catches problems before they become disputes.

Collectors are making trades they never would have attempted before. Complex multi-card exchanges with cash components that would have been too risky through informal channels now happen routinely.

The model has proven scalable and is expanding into other collectible categories where the same trust problems exist. Anywhere there's value, counterfeits, and strangers who want to trade—the platform solves a real problem.
