## The Business Problem

The sports card collecting market has a trust problem. Collectors want to trade valuable cards—sometimes worth thousands of dollars—but existing options are risky. How do you trade 3 Luka Dončić Silver Prizm PSA 10 cards for 3 Zion Williamson Silver PSA 10 cards plus $2,000 cash with a stranger on the internet?

Counterfeits are everywhere. Condition disputes kill deals. And without a trusted intermediary, high-value trades either don't happen or end badly. Collectors were stuck choosing between avoiding the trades they wanted or taking substantial financial risks on informal deals.

## The Solution

Big0 built a marketplace that makes complex trades safe and simple.

The key innovation: both parties ship their items to a central verification hub staffed by professional authenticators. Every card is verified for authenticity, condition, and specifications before any exchange happens. Cash components are held in secure escrow. Only after everything checks out does the trade complete.

The platform supports the complex trades collectors actually want to make—multiple cards on each side, cash to balance values, detailed negotiations. Real-time messaging keeps both parties informed throughout. And comprehensive tracking provides complete chain of custody from shipment to delivery.

For collectors, it means they can finally make the trades they've been avoiding. For the market, it means more liquidity and better price discovery.

## The Results

The marketplace created something new in the collectibles space: a way to make high-value trades with complete strangers safely. Since launch, not a single fraudulent transaction has completed—the verification process catches problems before they become disputes.

Collectors are making trades they never would have attempted before. Complex multi-card exchanges with cash components that would have been too risky through informal channels now happen routinely.

The model has proven scalable and is expanding into other collectible categories where the same trust problems exist. Anywhere there's value, counterfeits, and strangers who want to trade—the platform solves a real problem.
