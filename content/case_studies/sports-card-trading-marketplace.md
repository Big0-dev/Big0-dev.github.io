## The Business Problem

The sports card collecting market has a trust problem. Collectors want to trade valuable cards—sometimes worth thousands of dollars—but existing options are risky. How do you trade 3 Luka Doncic Silver Prizm PSA 10 cards for 3 Zion Williamson Silver PSA 10 cards plus $2,000 cash with a stranger on the internet?

Counterfeits are pervasive. Condition disputes kill deals. And without a trusted intermediary, high-value trades either don't happen or end badly. Collectors were stuck choosing between avoiding the trades they wanted or taking substantial financial risks on informal deals.

## The Solution

Big0 built a marketplace that makes complex trades safe through a physical verification layer.

Both parties ship their items to a central verification hub staffed by professional authenticators. Every card is verified for authenticity, condition, and grading specifications before any exchange happens. This eliminates the "is it really a PSA 10?" dispute before it starts.

Cash components are held in secure escrow. Only after both sides of a trade are verified does the exchange complete. If anything doesn't check out, items are returned and funds are released back.

The platform supports the complex trades collectors actually want to make—multiple cards on each side, cash to balance values, detailed negotiations through real-time messaging. Comprehensive tracking provides complete chain of custody from shipment through verification to delivery.

## The Security Infrastructure

Trust is engineered into the platform at every layer. Vault facilities feature 24/7 monitoring, biometric access controls, and insurance coverage through Lloyd's of London. Digital security includes bank-grade encryption for all data transmission and two-factor authentication for user accounts.

For disputes, the platform provides binding arbitration through industry experts who understand sports card grading nuances. Transparent audit trails document every card's journey from submission to final delivery, creating an immutable record that protects both parties.

## The Results

Since launch, not a single fraudulent transaction has completed. The verification process catches problems before they become disputes—counterfeits are identified, condition discrepancies are flagged, and both parties know exactly what they're getting before the trade executes.

Collectors are making trades they never would have attempted before. Complex multi-card exchanges with cash components that would have been too risky through informal channels now happen routinely on the platform.

The model has proven extensible beyond sports cards. Anywhere there's value, counterfeits, and strangers who want to trade—the same trust infrastructure solves the same problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a sports card trading marketplace?
A secure online platform where collectors buy, sell, and trade sports cards with professional authentication. Unlike standard auctions, these marketplaces facilitate direct swaps and complex multi-item trades with escrow protection.

### How do you trade sports cards safely?
Use a marketplace with escrow services and authentication verification. Cards are verified by professional graders before trades execute, and funds are held securely until both parties confirm. This eliminates counterfeiting and condition dispute risks.

### Why is there a trust problem in sports card collecting?
High-value cards can be worth thousands, making counterfeits and condition fraud lucrative. Without a neutral third party to verify authenticity and hold funds, high-value trades between strangers carry significant financial risk.

### How do marketplaces solve the liquidity problem for collectors?
Marketplaces create a centralized hub of verified buyers and traders. Instead of searching for specific trade partners privately, collectors list cards and connect with interested parties instantly—turning illiquid assets into tradable value.
