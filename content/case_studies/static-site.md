## The Business Problem

As a development consultancy, Big0 faced the classic "cobbler's shoes" problem. We needed a company website that demonstrated our capabilities without becoming a maintenance burden.

The options weren't appealing. WordPress means constant security updates and server management. Modern JavaScript frameworks introduce unnecessary complexity and dependency management. Hosted website builders lack the customization and performance our brand demands.

We wanted to spend our time on client work and business development—not maintaining our own website's infrastructure.

## The Solution

We built our own static site generator and practiced what we preach: eliminate everything that can break, require updates, or create security vulnerabilities.

Static files can't be hacked. They don't need security patches. They don't break due to dependency conflicts. Our website can run for years without any intervention.

Content updates are simple—our team writes in markdown, and the build process handles everything else: optimization, SEO metadata, structured data, image processing. Non-technical team members can contribute content through straightforward pull requests.

We use cutting-edge HTML and CSS features instead of JavaScript wherever possible. JavaScript is reserved for where it genuinely improves user experience: client-side search and gallery enhancements.

## The Results

The website has run without intervention since launch. No security patches, no server management, no dependency updates. Pages load instantly. Search engines love it.

More importantly, it demonstrates our development philosophy to every potential client who visits. Fast, simple, secure—and no ongoing costs or overhead.

For a consultancy, that's the point. Our website should showcase our approach, not consume our attention. It does exactly that.
