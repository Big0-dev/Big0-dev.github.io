## The Farm Visit

**Tariq Hussain:** Asif bhai, welcome! I know you've been curious about the drone since I started using it last season.

**Asif Mahmood:** Tariq, everyone at the market is talking about it. Your yields are up, your input costs are down—what's the secret?

**Tariq Hussain:** No secret. Just technology that finally makes sense for Pakistani farmers. Come, let me show you.

**Asif Mahmood:** I've looked at commercial drones before. They want six lakh, eight lakh rupees. For a farmer like me, that's impossible.

**Tariq Hussain:** That's exactly why I ignored drones for years. Then Big0 built something specifically for us.

## The Cost Problem

**Asif Mahmood:** What do you mean, for us?

**Tariq Hussain:** Pakistani farmers. Our conditions, our budgets, our crop types. The international drones are designed for American farms—thousands of acres, huge budgets, different crops entirely.

**Asif Mahmood:** Those drones cost as much as a good tractor.

**Tariq Hussain:** Exactly. Big0's drone costs about 3.5 lakh. Still significant, but achievable. And the ROI comes fast—I calculated payback within eighteen months on my operation.

**Asif Mahmood:** Three and a half lakh? That's 65% less than what I was quoted for commercial alternatives.

**Tariq Hussain:** Same performance capability. Different design philosophy. They optimized for our reality instead of trying to sell us Western equipment.

## The Technology

**Asif Mahmood:** Walk me through how it works.

**Tariq Hussain:** The drone carries pesticide or fertilizer in a tank. GPS navigation plans the flight path across the field. It sprays precisely where needed, adjusting for wind, maintaining consistent coverage.

**Asif Mahmood:** How much area can you cover?

**Tariq Hussain:** An acre in about seven and a half minutes. Compare that to manual spraying—sixteen minutes, maybe more, with laborers who get tired and inconsistent as the day goes on.

**Asif Mahmood:** That's almost twice as fast.

**Tariq Hussain:** And more accurate. The spray pattern is uniform. No missed spots, no over-application. Every area gets exactly what it needs.

## The Water Savings

**Asif Mahmood:** I heard you're using less water too?

**Tariq Hussain:** This was the biggest surprise. Manual spraying uses 59 liters of water per acre. The drone uses 10 liters.

**Asif Mahmood:** Ten liters? That can't be right.

**Tariq Hussain:** Precision application. The drone delivers smaller, more targeted droplets directly to the plants. No waste from overspray, no runoff. The chemical concentration stays optimal even with less water.

**Asif Mahmood:** With water becoming more expensive and harder to get, that matters.

**Tariq Hussain:** It matters enormously. My water costs dropped significantly. In a drought year, this could be the difference between a viable crop and a loss.

## The Results

**Asif Mahmood:** What about your actual crop outcomes?

**Tariq Hussain:** Better pest control because coverage is more consistent. Healthier plants because they're not getting over-sprayed in some areas and under-treated in others. My cotton yield improved 12% last season.

**Asif Mahmood:** Twelve percent improvement?

**Tariq Hussain:** Consistent input application. Every plant gets what it needs when it needs it. The precision makes a difference across hundreds of acres.

**Asif Mahmood:** And the laborers? What do they think?

**Tariq Hussain:** They're happier. Spraying pesticides is dangerous work—exposure risks, carrying heavy equipment in the heat. Now they monitor the drone, maintain it, handle loading. Safer, less physically demanding.

## The Practical Concerns

**Asif Mahmood:** What about learning to operate it? I'm not a technology expert.

**Tariq Hussain:** Neither am I. Big0 provided training—two days. The controls are simpler than you'd expect. My son learned it even faster than I did.

**Asif Mahmood:** What about maintenance?

**Tariq Hussain:** Basic maintenance I handle myself—cleaning, battery care. For anything more complex, they have support available. Parts are accessible, not proprietary components you can't find.

**Asif Mahmood:** Battery life?

**Tariq Hussain:** Multiple battery packs. While one charges, I fly with another. A full day's operation is no problem with proper planning.

## The Decision

**Asif Mahmood:** Tariq, I'm convinced. How do I get one?

**Tariq Hussain:** Contact Big0. They'll assess your farm size, your crop types, your specific needs. The system can be customized—tank capacity, spray nozzle configuration, flight patterns.

**Asif Mahmood:** What should I prepare?

**Tariq Hussain:** Know your acreage, your crop calendar, your current input costs. They'll help you calculate the ROI for your specific situation.

**Asif Mahmood:** My worry is always after-sale. What if something breaks?

**Tariq Hussain:** Their support has been good. I had a motor issue three months in—resolved within a week. They understand that when the drone is down during spraying season, we're losing money.

## The Bigger Picture

**Asif Mahmood:** You know what strikes me? We've always been told Pakistani farmers can't afford advanced technology.

**Tariq Hussain:** We couldn't afford Western technology designed for Western budgets. But technology designed for our conditions, our constraints? That's different.

**Asif Mahmood:** This could change everything for farms like ours.

**Tariq Hussain:** It already is. I know seven other farmers in this district who've bought drones since seeing mine. The word spreads when results are visible.

**Asif Mahmood:** Better yields, lower costs, less water, safer for workers. What's not to like?

**Tariq Hussain:** Nothing. This is how technology should work—solving real problems for the people who need solutions, not just the people who can afford premium prices.

**Asif Mahmood:** Tariq bhai, thank you for showing me everything. I'm calling Big0 tomorrow.

**Tariq Hussain:** Good decision, Asif. Next season, we'll compare notes on our results. Two neighbors with precision agriculture—the future has arrived in Punjab.
