## The Clinic Visit

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Sana, thank you for having me. I've been hearing about this AI system you're using, and I had to see it for myself.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Ahmed, welcome to Karachi! I'm excited to show you. Honestly, it's changed how I practice.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** I'm sceptical, I'll admit. We've been promised "revolutionary" dental technology before, and it usually doesn't work for our conditions here.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** I completely understand. The international platforms are designed for American and European markets. They don't account for our patient populations, our infrastructure limitations, our language needs.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Exactly. Constant internet connectivity? Expensive proprietary hardware? English-only interfaces that confuse my staff? None of that works in Lahore.

## The Technology Gap

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Let me show you how this is different. First, look at the hardware—it's a standard Android tablet. Not some specialized device that costs lakhs and only works with one vendor's software.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** That's the scanner?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** The scanner connects to it, yes. Affordable intraoral scanners that are already popular here. Big0 designed their platform to work with equipment Pakistani dentists can actually afford.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** What about the AI part?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Here's where it gets interesting. The AI was trained specifically on Pakistani patient data—over 50,000 scans from clinics across Punjab, Sindh, and KPK. Not Western datasets that don't reflect our patients' conditions.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** That makes a huge difference. The enamel erosion patterns we see from local dietary habits, the periodontal issues—international models miss these.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Exactly. This system catches them. Let me demonstrate with a patient this afternoon, if you'd like to observe.

## The Demonstration

**Dr. Sana Karim:** *[After the patient consultation]* So you saw the whole process. Capture the image, AI analysis runs, results in about 25 seconds.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** That was remarkable. The overlay showing problem areas, the confidence scores—my patients would understand that immediately.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Patient communication is one of the biggest benefits. When they can see visually what I'm describing, case acceptance rates go up significantly.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** And it identified that early cavity I wasn't sure about?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** With a high confidence score. The AI doesn't replace my judgment, but it's like having a very thorough second opinion on every patient. Things I might miss under time pressure, the system catches.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** I noticed you didn't need internet during that scan.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** The core AI processing works entirely offline. It syncs with the cloud when connectivity is available, but I can run a full clinic day without internet. You know how unreliable connections can be.

## Practical Considerations

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** What about the Urdu support? My receptionist doesn't read English well.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Full bilingual interface—Urdu and English with proper right-to-left rendering. My whole team uses it comfortably. Patient reports can be generated in either language.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** That alone solves a major problem for me. What about patient records?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Built-in practice management. Patient records, visit history, treatment plans—all integrated with the diagnostic system. The cloud sync means I can access records from home if needed.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Privacy concerns? We're dealing with medical data.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** AES-256 encryption, access controls, audit logging. They also use something called federated learning—the AI improves from usage patterns across clinics without actually centralizing sensitive patient information.

## Implementation Reality

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** How long did it take you to get up and running?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Less than two days. Big0's team came here, installed everything, configured it for my workflow, and trained my staff. They didn't just drop software and leave.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** And your staff adapted?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Within a week, everyone was comfortable. The interface is intuitive—they designed it for Pakistani dental practices, not just translated a Western product.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** What about ongoing support?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Excellent. I've had questions come up, unusual cases I wanted to discuss—they're responsive and actually understand dental practice. Not just IT people reading from scripts.

## The Business Case

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Let's talk money. What's the investment look like?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Significantly less than international alternatives—and no recurring cloud fees eating into margins. The tablet, scanner integration, software license, training—it's accessible for a mid-sized practice.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** And the return?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** I'm seeing more patients because assessments are faster. Case acceptance is higher because patients understand their conditions better. And I'm catching things early that would have been more expensive treatments later. The ROI came faster than I expected.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** You're also offering something competitors in Karachi aren't.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** That too. Patients talk. Word spreads when you have technology that makes their experience better. I've had new patients specifically mention the "AI scanner" as why they chose my clinic.

## The Recommendation

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Sana, I came here sceptical. I'm leaving convinced.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** I was where you are eight months ago. I'd tried international platforms that didn't work for us. Big0 was different because they built specifically for our market, our constraints, our needs.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Who do I contact?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** I'll make an introduction. They can do a demo at your clinic in Lahore, show you exactly how it would work with your patient population.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** What should I prepare?

**Dr. Sana Karim:** Just think about your biggest diagnostic challenges. Cases you wish you had better tools for. They'll show you how the system handles those specific situations.

**Dr. Ahmed Raza:** Thank you for taking the time to show me all this. It's given me real hope that we can offer our patients better care without needing international budgets.

**Dr. Sana Karim:** That's exactly what motivated me. Our patients deserve access to the same diagnostic quality as patients anywhere in the world. Now they can have it.
