faqs:
  - q: What types of financial software do you build?
    a: Platforms that automate financial workflows — lending operations, payment processing, credit assessment, portfolio management, and compliance reporting. We focus on multi-party workflows where manual processes are creating bottlenecks.
  - q: How do you handle financial regulations?
    a: Compliance is built into every project from day one — audit trails, encryption, role-based access, data residency requirements. We've built for FCA-regulated environments and GDPR-compliant systems. We don't bolt compliance on at the end.
  - q: How long does a fintech platform take to build?
    a: An MVP typically ships in 8-12 weeks. Full platforms with integrations and compliance take 4-9 months. You see working demos every two weeks throughout.
  - q: Can you integrate with existing banking systems?
    a: Yes. We connect with payment processors, credit bureaus, document signing services, and existing financial infrastructure. Our premium finance platform integrates with Experian, DocuSign, and multiple payment systems.
