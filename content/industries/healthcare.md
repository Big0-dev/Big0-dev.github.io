faqs:
  - q: How do you ensure HIPAA compliance?
    a: "HIPAA compliance is designed into every system from day one — end-to-end encryption, role-based access controls, audit logging, secure file storage, and multi-factor authentication. We don't build the system and then add compliance. We've shipped healthcare platforms with perfect compliance records."
  - q: Can you integrate with our existing EHR system?
    a: Yes. We build systems that connect with existing healthcare infrastructure — EHRs, lab systems, insurance platforms. We don't ask you to replace everything. We make your existing systems work better together.
  - q: How do you handle patient data security?
    a: Every piece of patient data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Access is logged and auditable. Our federated learning research (published in PLOS ONE) specifically addresses how to build AI for healthcare without centralizing sensitive data.
  - q: How long does a healthcare platform take to build?
    a: An MVP with core document management and compliance typically ships in 10-14 weeks. Full platforms with integrations and workflow automation take 4-8 months.
