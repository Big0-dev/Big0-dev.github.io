faqs:
  - q: What kind of legal documents can your AI analyze?
    a: Contracts, regulatory filings, case files, due diligence materials, and correspondence. We build systems that extract key terms, identify risks, and flag issues. The AI learns from your specific document types and gets more accurate over time.
  - q: How do you handle legal confidentiality requirements?
    a: "Every system is built with encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access controls, audit logging, and matter-level data segregation. We've built for UK data residency requirements and GDPR-compliant environments. Confidentiality is the foundation, not an afterthought."
  - q: How long does a legal AI tool take to build?
    a: A focused document analysis tool for specific document types typically ships in 10-14 weeks. Full practice management platforms with integrations take 4-8 months.
  - q: Will AI replace lawyers?
    a: "No. AI handles the repetitive work — document scanning, data extraction, initial categorization. Lawyers handle the judgment, strategy, and client relationships that require human expertise. The goal is to free lawyers from administrative tasks, not replace them."
