faqs:
  - q: Can you integrate with our existing TMS/WMS?
    a: Yes. We build integration layers that connect existing systems — whatever TMS, WMS, or carrier portals you already use. We don't ask you to replace working systems. We make them work together.
  - q: How long does a logistics dashboard take to build?
    a: A core operations dashboard with real-time data from 2-3 source systems typically ships in 8-12 weeks. More complex integrations with multiple carriers and locations take 4-6 months.
  - q: Do you work with small logistics companies or just large enterprises?
    a: Both. Our dashboard work includes global operations across 50+ countries, but the same principles apply to smaller operations. If you have visibility problems or disconnected systems, we can help regardless of scale.
  - q: Can you handle real-time data at scale?
    a: Yes. Our logistics dashboard handles real-time data across 50+ countries with sub-second updates. We build on scalable cloud infrastructure designed for high-throughput data processing.
