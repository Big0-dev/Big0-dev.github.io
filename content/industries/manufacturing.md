capabilities:
  - title: Equipment Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance
    desc: Sensor networks on your equipment — vibration, temperature, pressure, current draw — with monitoring that flags problems before they become failures. Scheduled maintenance based on real data.

  - title: Computer Vision Quality Inspection
    desc: Visual inspection at production speed — detecting defects, grading quality, counting items. The system learns what "good" looks like from your specific products and improves over time.

faqs:
  - q: What kind of equipment can you monitor?
    a: Anything with moving parts, temperature, pressure, vibration, or electrical current. CNC machines, pumps, compressors, conveyor systems, HVAC, generators — if it can have a sensor attached, we can monitor it and predict when it needs maintenance.
  - q: How accurate is computer vision quality inspection?
    a: Accuracy depends on your product and defect types, but our systems typically match or exceed human inspector accuracy while running at production speed without fatigue. We train on your specific products and iterate until accuracy meets your requirements.
  - q: Do we need to replace our existing systems?
    a: No. We integrate with what you already have — PLCs, SCADA systems, existing sensors, ERPs. We add the intelligence layer on top of your current infrastructure.
  - q: How long until we see results?
    a: Sensor installation and basic monitoring can be running in 4-6 weeks. Predictive maintenance models need 2-3 months of data before they're reliable. Computer vision systems are typically production-ready in 6-10 weeks.
