faqs:
  - q: How do you keep costs affordable for non-profits?
    a: "We design for cost from the start — choosing the right infrastructure for your scale, using open-source tools where appropriate, and building systems that are simple to maintain. We've delivered platforms at a fraction of what traditional cloud setups would cost."
  - q: Can you work with messy data?
    a: "Yes. Data cleanup is often the first step. We've taken a 150,000-record database that was 96% junk and turned it into a clean, verified member list. We build validation systems that keep your data clean going forward."
  - q: Do you build bilingual or multilingual platforms?
    a: Yes. Our civic engagement platform was built with full bilingual support including right-to-left (RTL) text rendering. We build for the languages your community actually uses.
  - q: How long does a non-profit platform take to build?
    a: A member management platform with basic analytics typically ships in 8-12 weeks. Full platforms with engagement tools, multi-channel communication, and impact reporting take 3-6 months.
