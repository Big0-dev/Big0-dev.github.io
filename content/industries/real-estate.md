faqs:
  - q: What kind of real estate data can you aggregate?
    a: Public records, MLS feeds, demographic data, market trends, comparable sales, rental rates, and custom data sources specific to your market. We build data pipelines that pull from multiple sources and keep everything updated automatically.
  - q: Can you integrate with our existing property management software?
    a: Yes. We integrate with accounting platforms, payment processors, and existing property management tools. We add capability on top of what you already use rather than replacing everything.
  - q: How long does a real estate analytics platform take to build?
    a: A core analytics dashboard with 2-3 data sources typically ships in 10-14 weeks. Full platforms with multiple data sources, subscription billing, and advanced visualizations take 4-8 months.
  - q: Do you handle both the hardware and software for smart buildings?
    a: Yes. Our team covers sensor hardware, connectivity, cloud infrastructure, and the dashboards and apps that make the data useful. You don't need separate hardware and software vendors.
