## Design Philosophy

We believe humanoid robots should be:
- **Practical** - Designed for real tasks, not just demonstrations
- **Safe** - Built with multiple safety systems for human interaction
- **Adaptable** - Capable of learning and adjusting to new environments
- **Accessible** - Engineered to be maintainable and cost-effective

## Key Capabilities

### Mobility & Navigation
- Bipedal locomotion with balance recovery
- Autonomous navigation in complex environments
- Obstacle avoidance and path planning
- Stair climbing and uneven terrain handling

### Manipulation
- Dual-arm coordination for complex tasks
- Precision gripping and force control
- Tool use and object handling
- Adaptive grasp planning
