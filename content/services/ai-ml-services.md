faqs:
  - q: "How do you know AI is the right solution for my problem?"
    a: "Sometimes it isn't. We start every engagement with an honest assessment. If
      your problem is better solved with a simple database query or a process change,
      we'll tell you that — and save you the AI budget for where it actually matters."
  - q: "How long until we see results?"
    a: "A working prototype typically ships in 2-4 weeks. Production systems take
      2-6 months. You'll see demos every two weeks, so you're never waiting months
      to find out if the approach works."
  - q: "What about our existing systems?"
    a: "We integrate with what you already have. Our AI systems connect to your
      databases, your document management, your ERP — whatever your team uses today.
      We don't ask you to rip and replace."
  - q: "Is our data safe?"
    a: "Yes. We built a peer-reviewed federated learning system specifically for
      privacy-sensitive healthcare data. We know how to handle sensitive information
      in regulated environments — GDPR, HIPAA, FCA compliance are part of how we
      design, not afterthoughts."
  - q: "What happens after you deliver?"
    a: "We provide monitoring, maintenance, and continuous improvement. Models drift
      over time, requirements change, and your team will want new features. We plan
      for all of that from day one."
