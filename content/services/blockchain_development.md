### How do you ensure system security and compliance?
We implement defense-in-depth security architectures with continuous vulnerability scanning, automated penetration testing, and real-time threat monitoring. All smart contracts undergo formal verification and third-party security audits before deployment.

### What is your approach to system integration?
Our integration methodology prioritizes API-first design, microservices architecture, and event-driven communication patterns. We implement circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation to ensure system resilience during integration phases.

### How do you select optimal blockchain platforms?
Platform evaluation considers transaction throughput requirements, consensus mechanism efficiency, developer ecosystem maturity, and long-term scalability roadmaps. We benchmark performance across test environments before making architectural recommendations.

### What ongoing technical support do you provide?
Comprehensive support includes 24/7 system monitoring, automated alerting, performance optimization, security patch management, and technical documentation maintenance. Our DevOps team ensures continuous system reliability and performance.

### How do you measure system performance and reliability?
We establish comprehensive monitoring dashboards tracking transaction throughput, response times, error rates, system availability, and resource utilization. Performance baselines are established during testing phases with continuous optimization post-deployment.
