faqs:
  - q: "How long does a typical project take?"
    a: "An MVP ships in 8-12 weeks. Full platforms take 4-9 months. You see working
      software every two weeks, so you're never in the dark about progress."
  - q: "Can you add AI features to our software?"
    a: "Yes — it's one of our strengths. We embed document intelligence, automated
      workflows, and smart features into new and existing applications. The AI works
      inside your software, not as a separate tool."
  - q: "What happens if requirements change mid-project?"
    a: "They always do. We work in 2-week sprints specifically so we can adapt.
      Changing direction in week 6 is easy. Changing direction in month 12 of a
      waterfall project is expensive."
  - q: "Do you provide ongoing maintenance?"
    a: "Yes. Bug fixes, security updates, performance optimization, and feature
      enhancements. We build it, we stand behind it."
  - q: "How do you handle sensitive data?"
    a: "We've built systems for healthcare, finance, and legal — industries where
      getting data security wrong has real consequences. Encryption, audit trails,
      and access controls are part of how we build, not add-ons."
