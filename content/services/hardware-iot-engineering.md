challenge: "You have a concept for a physical product — a device, a sensor, a machine,
  a connected thing. You need it designed, engineered, prototyped, tested, and ready
  for manufacturing. That's what we do."

faqs:
  - q: "How long does it take to go from idea to working prototype?"
    a: "Simple connected devices: 4-6 weeks. Complex products with custom electronics
      and mechanical design: 3-6 months. You'll hold a 3D-printed prototype much
      earlier than that."
  - q: "Can you handle manufacturing?"
    a: "We provide complete manufacturing documentation, production test procedures,
      and supplier relationships. We support single prototypes through to mass
      production at 10,000+ units."
  - q: "What about regulatory compliance?"
    a: "We design for FCC, CE, and UL certification from the start — not as an
      afterthought. We handle EMC testing, safety compliance, and the documentation
      required for certification."
  - q: "Can you add connectivity to our existing product?"
    a: "Yes. We retrofit existing products and equipment with sensors, connectivity,
      and cloud management. Your hardware doesn't need to be designed by us to be
      made smart by us."
  - q: "Do you handle the software side too?"
    a: "Completely. Cloud platforms, mobile apps, dashboards, APIs — the full stack
      that makes a connected product useful. That's the advantage of working with a
      firm that does both hardware and software."
