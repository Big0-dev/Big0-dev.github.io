## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is blockchain legal in Australia?

Yes, blockchain technology is legal in Australia with clear regulatory frameworks. ASIC regulates crypto-assets that are financial products, ATO provides tax guidance, and AUSTRAC oversees digital currency exchanges. Australia is considered a blockchain-friendly jurisdiction with supportive government policies and innovation programs encouraging adoption.

### How much does blockchain development cost in Australia?

Blockchain development costs in Australia range from $15,000 for simple smart contracts to $500,000+ for enterprise platforms. Costs depend on complexity, compliance requirements, platform choice, and ongoing support needs. We provide fixed-price quotes after discovery phase with transparent breakdown of development, audit, compliance, and deployment costs.

### Do I need ASIC approval for blockchain projects?

ASIC approval requirements depend on your blockchain application. If you're issuing crypto-assets that are financial products (securities, managed investment schemes), you likely need an AFSL or must comply with exemptions. We provide regulatory assessment services to determine your obligations and guide you through licensing or exemption processes.

### How long does blockchain development take?

Timeline depends on project scope. Simple smart contracts take 4-8 weeks, NFT marketplaces 12-20 weeks, and enterprise blockchain platforms 6-12 months. Australian regulatory compliance adds 2-4 weeks for reviews and audits. We use agile methodology with 2-week sprints to deliver value incrementally and maintain flexibility.

### Can blockchain integrate with existing Australian systems?

Absolutely. We specialize in integrating blockchain with Australian business systems including accounting software (Xero, MYOB), payment gateways (NAB, CBA, Stripe), banking APIs (via NPP), PEXA for property settlement, and ASX systems. Our integration approach ensures seamless data flow while maintaining security and compliance.

### What about crypto tax compliance in Australia?

We build ATO compliance into all blockchain solutions, including transaction classification, cost base tracking, CGT calculation, and record-keeping. Our systems generate tax reports compatible with Australian tax software and provide the documentation required for ATO audits. We partner with crypto-specialized accounting firms for complex tax situations.

### Is my blockchain data secure and private?

Security is our top priority. All our blockchain solutions undergo rigorous security audits, penetration testing, and formal verification. We implement Australian Privacy Principles-compliant data handling, encryption at rest and in transit, multi-signature controls, and 24/7 monitoring. We carry professional indemnity insurance and cybersecurity insurance for Australian deployments.
