## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an AFSL or ACL to operate a fintech in Brisbane?

It depends on your fintech business model. If you provide financial advice, deal in financial products, or provide credit, you likely need licensing. AFSL is required for investment products, AFSL+ACL for credit products. Some fintechs operate under representative arrangements or exemptions. We provide comprehensive regulatory assessment to determine your licensing requirements and support the application process.

### How long does it take to build a fintech platform in Brisbane?

Timelines vary significantly. An MVP payment solution takes 3-6 months, a digital lending platform 6-12 months, and a full digital banking platform 12-24 months. Australian regulatory compliance, security requirements, and payment network certifications add 4-12 weeks. We use agile methodology to deliver working software early and iterate based on user feedback.

Australian fintech development ranges from $150,000 for basic payment gateways to $5M+ for full digital banking platforms.

We build compliance into every stage of development. Our process includes regulatory requirements mapping, automated compliance controls, audit trails for all transactions, regulatory reporting automation, and regular compliance reviews. We maintain relationships with legal and compliance advisors, stay current with regulatory changes, and have dedicated compliance specialists reviewing all financial products.
