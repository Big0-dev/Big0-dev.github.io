## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are your training courses eligible for government funding in Brisbane?

Yes, our AQF-aligned certificate and diploma programs delivered through RTO partnerships are eligible for government subsidies in most Australian states. This includes Skills First in Victoria, Smart and Skilled in NSW, Higher Level Skills in Queensland, and similar programs in other states. Eligibility depends on factors like age, employment status, previous qualifications, and citizenship/residency. We can assess your eligibility during enrollment. Individual certification courses (AWS, Azure, CISSP, etc.) are not government-subsidized but may be covered by employer training budgets or Skills First's Skills and Training Incentive for employers.

### Do you provide training aligned with Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) requirements?

Absolutely. Our cybersecurity training is specifically designed around ACSC frameworks including Essential Eight Maturity Model and the Information Security Manual (ISM). We offer dedicated Essential Eight implementation training covering all eight mitigation strategies at maturity levels 1-3, ISM fundamentals and advanced courses, and IRAP (Information Security Registered Assessors Program) preparation. Our trainers have experience with Australian government agencies and understand PSPF (Protective Security Policy Framework) requirements. This training is critical for government agencies, defense contractors, and organizations in regulated industries (banking, healthcare) that must meet Australian security standards.

### Can training be customized for our Australian organization's specific needs?

Yes, all our corporate training can be customized to your organization's specific Australian context, technologies, and business requirements. Customization options include: using your actual cloud environments and systems for hands-on labs, incorporating your organization's Australian compliance requirements (APRA, ASIC, Privacy Act), focusing on your specific technology stack and architecture, including case studies from your industry sector, aligning with your internal methodologies and standards, and scheduling around Australian business calendar and public holidays. We conduct pre-training consultations to understand your goals, assess current skill levels, and design optimal training programs. Custom content typically adds 10-20% to standard course pricing.

### What certifications are most valued by Australian employers?

Based on our placement data and employer feedback, the most valued certifications in the Australian IT market are: (1) Cloud - AWS Solutions Architect and Azure certifications dominate, with AWS slightly ahead due to strong Australian adoption, (2) Cybersecurity - CISSP for management roles, CompTIA Security+ for entry-level, and CEH for technical roles are most requested, (3) Agile - SAFe certifications are prevalent in large Australian enterprises and government, while CSM is common in mid-market and startups, (4) Data - Power BI certifications are highly valued as it's the dominant BI tool in Brisbanen organizations, (5) Australian-specific - Essential Eight and IRAP are critical for government work. We recommend certifications based on your career goals and target employers.

### Do you offer training in regional Australian cities beyond Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane?

Yes, we deliver training in regional Australian cities through virtual instructor-led training (VILT) optimized for Australian time zones, and on-site corporate training if you have 8+ participants. We've successfully delivered training in Canberra, Perth, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Newcastle, Wollongong, Geelong, Hobart, and Darwin. Virtual training provides the same quality as in-person with live instructor interaction, hands-on labs, and certification preparation. For groups of 8+ in regional areas, we can send trainers to your location with on-site pricing plus travel costs. Regional participants can also attend our Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane public courses - we provide course schedules 3-4 months in advance to facilitate travel planning.

### What is your trainer quality and experience level?

All Big0 trainers meet stringent quality standards: minimum 10+ years industry experience in their domain, active consulting or project work (not just training) to maintain current skills, relevant certifications (e.g., AWS instructors are AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional minimum), proven training delivery experience with consistently high evaluation scores (4.5/5.0+), and deep understanding of Australian IT market, compliance requirements, and business context. Many trainers have worked for major Australian enterprises or government agencies. We conduct annual trainer assessments, peer reviews, and student feedback analysis to maintain quality. Our trainer retention rate is 92%, ensuring continuity and experience accumulation.
