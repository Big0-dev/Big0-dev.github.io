## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does AI development cost in Sydney?

AI development costs in Sydney typically range from $40,000 for simple ML models to $500,000+ for enterprise platforms. Costs depend on data complexity, model sophistication, integration requirements, and compliance needs. We offer proof-of-concept projects from $30,000 to demonstrate value before larger commitments. All pricing includes Australian regulatory compliance and responsible AI implementation.

### How long does it take to build an AI solution?

Timelines vary by project complexity. A proof of concept takes 4-8 weeks, production ML models 3-6 months, and enterprise AI platforms 6-12 months. We use agile methodology with 2-week sprints delivering incremental value. Australian regulatory compliance (OAIC, APRA, TGA) typically adds 2-4 weeks for documentation and approval processes.

### Is my data safe and compliant with Australian privacy laws?

Absolutely. We maintain full compliance with Australia's Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). All data is stored in Sydneyn data centers, encrypted at rest and in transit, with strict access controls. We implement privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy and federated learning where appropriate. We maintain ISO 27001 certification and conduct regular security audits.

### Can AI integrate with our existing Australian business systems?

Yes. We specialize in integrating AI with Australian business systems including ERP platforms (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite), accounting software (Xero, MYOB), CRM systems (Salesforce, Dynamics), and industry-specific platforms. We work with Australian data formats, timezone considerations, and local business processes to ensure seamless integration.

### Do you provide AI training for our Australian team?

Yes. We offer comprehensive training programs tailored to Australian businesses including executive AI awareness sessions, technical team training, end-user training, and responsible AI governance training. Training can be delivered on-site across Australian cities or virtually, with materials customized to your industry and use cases.

### How do you ensure AI models remain accurate over time?

We implement MLOps pipelines with continuous monitoring for model performance, data drift, and concept drift. Automated alerts notify when performance degrades, and we establish retraining schedules based on your data patterns. All our production AI deployments include ongoing monitoring and maintenance with SLA-backed response times.

### What about AI bias and fairness for Australian populations?

We implement comprehensive bias testing across Australian demographic dimensions including state/territory, urban/rural, age, gender, and socioeconomic factors. We follow Australia's AI Ethics Framework principles and provide regular fairness audits. All models include explainability features allowing human review and contestability as required by Australian regulations.
