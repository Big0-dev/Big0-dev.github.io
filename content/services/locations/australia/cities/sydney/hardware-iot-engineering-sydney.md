## Frequently Asked Questions

### What ACMA certifications do IoT devices need in Sydney?

IoT devices sold or deployed in Sydney must comply with ACMA electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards and carry C-Tick certification. Devices with radio transmitters require compliance with AS/NZS 4268 and radiocommunications standards. We design hardware from the ground up for ACMA compliance, conduct pre-compliance testing, and manage the certification process through accredited Australian test labs. For devices connecting to carrier networks (Telstra, Optus, TPG), additional carrier certification may be required.

### Which IoT connectivity option is best for my Australian application?

The optimal connectivity depends on your use case:
- **NB-IoT/LTE-M**: Best for mobile applications, urban areas, and locations with Telstra/Optus coverage. Excellent for asset tracking, smart metering, and environmental monitoring.
- **LoRaWAN**: Ideal for large properties (agriculture, mining), smart cities, and applications requiring low power consumption with moderate data rates. Lower cost than cellular for multi-sensor deployments.
- **Satellite IoT**: Essential for remote Sydney beyond cellular coverage. Myriota (Adelaide-based) offers cost-effective small data messaging for environmental and asset monitoring.
- **WiFi/Ethernet**: Best for facility-based applications with existing network infrastructure.

We often recommend multi-mode devices that can switch between connectivity types based on availability and cost optimization.

### How do you handle IoT deployments in remote Australian locations?

Remote deployments require specialized approaches:
- **Power**: Solar panels with battery backup sized for worst-case Australian weather conditions (7+ days autonomy). MPPT charge controllers and LiFePO4 batteries for extreme temperature tolerance.
- **Connectivity**: Multi-carrier SIM for Telstra/Optus redundancy, satellite IoT backup, or store-and-forward protocols that cache data during connectivity outages.
- **Installation**: Ruggedized IP68 enclosures with UV protection, professional installation by technicians experienced with remote Australian conditions, and comprehensive documentation for local maintenance.
- **Support**: Remote diagnostics, OTA firmware updates, and partnerships with local service providers in regional areas for physical intervention when needed.

### What's the typical development timeline for custom IoT hardware?

Australian IoT hardware development typically follows this timeline:
- **Proof of Concept**: 6-10 weeks for initial prototype and feasibility validation
- **Production Design**: 10-16 weeks for refined design, PCB layout, and firmware development
- **Compliance Testing**: 4-8 weeks for ACMA EMC testing and certification
- **Pilot Production**: 4-6 weeks for initial production run (50-500 units)
- **Pilot Deployment**: 8-12 weeks for field installation and validation

Total timeline from concept to pilot deployment: **6-9 months**. Projects requiring carrier certification or specialized environmental testing may add 4-8 weeks. We expedite timelines with parallel activities and leverage Australian PCB manufacturers for quick turnaround prototyping.

### How do you ensure IoT data security and privacy for Australian deployments?

We implement multi-layer security:
