## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the benefits of using Australian cloud regions versus international regions?

Australian cloud regions provide critical benefits for businesses operating in Australia. Data sovereignty is the primary advantage, ensuring personal information and sensitive business data remains within Australian jurisdiction, meeting Privacy Act requirements and customer expectations. Latency is significantly reduced for Australian users, with 5-15ms response times to Sydney compared to 150-200ms to US West regions, directly improving application performance and user experience.

Regulatory compliance becomes straightforward when using Australian regions. Government agencies must use Australian regions for many workloads under the Protective Security Policy Framework. Financial institutions find APRA compliance easier with data residency controls. Healthcare organizations meet Privacy Act requirements for patient information. While Australian regions historically carried premium pricing of 5-15% versus US regions, cost optimization strategies including reserved instances, savings plans, and right-sizing typically offset this premium while delivering superior performance and compliance.

### How long does cloud migration typically take for Australian businesses?

Migration timelines vary significantly based on infrastructure complexity, application dependencies, and regulatory requirements. Small business migrations involving 10-50 servers with simple applications typically complete in 2-4 months including assessment, planning, migration execution, and stabilization. Medium enterprise migrations with 50-200 servers, multiple applications, and database dependencies generally require 4-8 months with phased migration approaches reducing risk.

Large enterprise migrations exceeding 200 servers with complex application portfolios, mainframe integration, and extensive dependencies often span 8-18 months with multiple migration waves. Government migrations add time for security assessment, IRAP compliance verification, and security clearance requirements, typically adding 2-4 months to comparable commercial projects. The migration timeline includes assessment and planning (4-8 weeks), pilot migration and testing (4-6 weeks), production migration waves (8-20 weeks depending on scale), and hypercare and optimization (4-8 weeks). Phased approaches enable businesses to realize cloud benefits progressively while managing risk and resource constraints.

### What does IRAP certification mean and do I need it?

IRAP (Information Security Registered Assessors Program) certification involves independent security assessment of cloud services against the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM). IRAP assessors evaluate cloud providers and services, verifying security controls meet government requirements. Certification levels include Unclassified, Official, Protected, Secret, and Top Secret, with most commercial and government workloads operating at Official or Protected levels.

You need IRAP certification if you're an Australian Government agency or contractor handling government information, a business in regulated industries where customers require IRAP compliance, or operating in critical infrastructure sectors with security obligations. AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all maintain IRAP Protected certification for their Australian regions, enabling compliant workload hosting. Even if IRAP isn't mandatory, implementing ISM security controls provides strong security posture aligned with Australian best practices. Our cloud architectures for government clients use IRAP-assessed services implementing required security controls with comprehensive audit evidence.

### How do Australian cloud providers compare on pricing?

Australian cloud region pricing varies across providers with strategic considerations beyond simple per-hour costs. AWS generally offers the most mature Australian presence with the longest-established Sydney region, extensive service availability, and competitive pricing through reserved instances and savings plans. Compute instances typically price 8-12% above US East with frequent promotional credits and discounts.

Azure provides strong integration with Microsoft enterprise tools, competitive pricing for Windows workloads, and attractive hybrid benefits for organizations with existing Microsoft licensing. Licensing portability and Azure Hybrid Benefit often provide significant savings. Google Cloud delivers competitive pricing on data analytics and machine learning services, innovative per-second billing, and sustained use discounts automatically applied without commitment. Multi-year commitments provide the deepest discounts across all providers.

Pricing considerations extend beyond hourly rates to include data transfer costs, managed service pricing, support plan costs, and licensing implications. We typically recommend multi-cloud approaches leveraging each provider's pricing strengths: AWS for general-purpose compute and broad service availability, Azure for Microsoft workloads and enterprise integration, and Google Cloud for data analytics and ML workloads. Total cost of ownership analysis across 3-year periods provides accurate comparison accounting for all cost factors.

### What happens to my data if there's a cloud provider outage?

Cloud provider outages, while rare, require planning for business continuity. Major Australian cloud regions maintain excellent availability with AWS Sydney historically achieving 99.99%+ availability, meaning less than 1 hour downtime annually. Azure Australia East and Google Cloud Sydney maintain similar availability records. When regional outages occur, impact depends on your architecture design.

Single availability zone deployments experience downtime during zone failures. Multi-AZ architectures within a region provide high availability with automatic failover across availability zones within the same region, typically completing in seconds to minutes. Applications continue operating during single zone failures. Multi-region architectures provide maximum resilience with workload replication across Sydney and Melbourne regions (for Azure) or Sydney and Singapore (for AWS/GCP), enabling business continuity during complete regional outages, though with higher complexity and cost.

Our cloud architectures implement resilience matching business requirements: critical systems use multi-AZ deployment with auto-scaling and automated failover, important systems implement regular backups with documented recovery procedures, and standard systems accept occasional downtime with backup-based recovery. All architectures include comprehensive backup strategies with automated backups daily or more frequently, backup replication to secondary regions, and regular recovery testing validating procedures. We provide disaster recovery planning with defined RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) matching business requirements.

### Do I need to hire additional staff to manage cloud infrastructure?

Cloud adoption typically changes rather than necessarily increases IT staffing requirements. Organizations commonly take several approaches: augment existing teams with cloud-managed services where we provide 24/7 monitoring, security management, and optimization while your team focuses on applications and business requirements. This often provides the best balance of control and efficiency.

Reskill existing infrastructure staff through training programs, vendor certifications, and hands-on projects enabling system administrators and network engineers to transition to cloud roles. Many infrastructure skills transfer directly to cloud environments. Hybrid IT models maintain small infrastructure teams for on-premises systems while leveraging managed services for cloud environments, common during multi-year cloud transitions.

Fully outsourced models engage managed service providers for complete infrastructure management, allowing businesses to focus entirely on applications and business value. This suits organizations without strong IT teams or those preferring to focus resources elsewhere. The optimal model depends on existing IT capability, business requirements for control and customization, regulatory requirements for Australian-based support, and budget considerations for internal staff versus managed services. We commonly see organizations start with our managed services while building internal cloud capability, gradually transitioning to shared management as skills develop.

### How do you ensure compliance with Australian privacy laws?

Privacy Act compliance requires comprehensive technical and organizational controls throughout cloud infrastructure. Our compliance approach addresses all aspects of Australian privacy legislation. Data residency controls ensure personal information is stored and processed exclusively in Australian cloud regions using geofencing, region-locking, and architectural controls preventing data replication to international locations. Data classification and handling procedures identify personal information, sensitive information, and health information, applying appropriate controls based on classification with automated policy enforcement.

Access controls implement principle of least privilege, multi-factor authentication for all access, comprehensive audit logging of all access to personal information, regular access reviews removing unnecessary permissions, and segregation of duties for sensitive operations. Encryption protections include encryption at rest using AES-256 for all stored personal information, encryption in transit using TLS 1.3 for all data transmission, key management using cloud-native key management services (KMS) or hardware security modules (HSM), and encrypted backups stored in Australian regions.

Vendor management addresses cloud provider privacy commitments through data processing agreements covering collection, use, disclosure, storage, and access to personal information, regular vendor assessments evaluating ongoing privacy compliance, and documented due diligence processes. Data breach procedures implement detection through security monitoring and anomaly detection, assessment of breach scope and risk to individuals, notification procedures aligned with Privacy Act requirements for notifiable data breaches, and remediation to prevent recurrence. We provide regular compliance reporting with quarterly privacy compliance assessments, annual Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for new systems and material changes, and ongoing advisory services addressing evolving OAIC guidance and regulatory expectations.
