## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do your engineers have appropriate Australian registration?
Yes, our engineering team includes Chartered Professional Engineers (CPEng) registered with Engineers Australia and state-specific registrations where required by legislation. For Queensland projects involving prescribed building work, we hold RPEQ (Registered Professional Engineer Queensland) registration. For New South Wales, our engineers are listed on NPER (National Professional Engineers Register). For Victorian building work, we maintain VBA registration as engineering practitioners. CPEng status demonstrates engineering competency assessed against international standards including appropriate qualifications (accredited Australian engineering degrees), minimum professional experience requirements (typically 5+ years post-graduation), demonstrated engineering competencies, and ongoing Continuing Professional Development (CPD). Our registration status is verifiable through Engineers Australia and state authority registers. We assign appropriately registered engineers to your project based on location and building work type ensuring regulatory compliance.

### What is the difference between structural and civil engineering?
Structural engineering focuses on building structures—the framework of beams, columns, slabs, foundations, and load-bearing walls that support buildings and resist gravity, wind, and earthquake forces. Structural engineers design the concrete, steel, timber, or masonry elements that form office buildings, apartment towers, houses, warehouses, and industrial facilities. Civil engineering addresses site development and infrastructure—roads, earthworks, drainage systems, retaining walls, subdivisions, water and sewer networks, and pavements. Civil engineers design what happens outside and around the building including site grading, stormwater management, and utility connections. For most building projects you need both: structural engineers for the building itself, civil engineers for site works. Our multidisciplinary team provides both structural and civil engineering as integrated service, ensuring coordination between building and site design. Some projects are purely civil (road upgrades, subdivisions without buildings) or purely structural (building alterations, new structure on existing site), but commercial and residential developments typically require both engineering disciplines working together.

### How much does structural engineering cost for a house in Australia?
Structural engineering fees for residential houses in Australia typically range from AUD $2,500 to $6,000 depending on house size, complexity, site conditions, and documentation requirements. A standard single-story house on flat site with straightforward soil conditions (Class A or S sites) generally costs AUD $2,500-3,500 for complete structural engineering including footing/foundation design, floor framing, roof framing, and wind classification to AS 4055. Two-story houses with more complex framing, multiple roof levels, or architectural features requiring structural steel beams cost AUD $3,500-5,000. Houses on reactive clay sites (Class H or E sites) requiring stiffened raft foundations with edge beams cost additional AUD $1,000-2,000 for geotechnical-informed foundation design. Sloping sites requiring retaining walls, suspended slabs, or multi-level construction increase fees to AUD $4,500-6,000+. Fees include structural drawings and specifications suitable for builder quoting and council approval. Some councils require additional documentation (engineer's design certificate, compliance statements) which may attract modest additional fees. Our residential structural engineering provides buildable, cost-effective designs optimized for Australian construction methods and materials.

### Do you provide NCC Section J energy efficiency compliance services?
Yes, we provide comprehensive NCC Section J energy efficiency compliance services for commercial buildings (BCA Volume One) including JV3 verification calculations, HVAC system efficiency assessments, and building fabric thermal performance analysis. Section J of the National Construction Code sets minimum energy efficiency requirements for building envelope (walls, roofs, glazing), building services (HVAC, lighting, hot water), and energy usage. For commercial buildings, compliance is typically demonstrated via JV3 calculation—detailed thermal simulation using approved software (IES-VE, Hourly Analysis Program, EnergyPlus) comparing proposed building's annual energy consumption against reference building meeting minimum standards. Our mechanical engineers conduct JV3 assessments for office buildings, retail centers, healthcare facilities, educational buildings, and other commercial projects, optimizing HVAC systems, building envelope specifications, and glazing performance to achieve compliance while balancing capital cost and operational efficiency. We also advise on exceeding minimum Section J requirements to achieve NABERS Energy ratings (4-6 star targets), Green Star energy credits, and reduced operating costs. Typical JV3 assessment fees range from AUD $2,500 for simple buildings to AUD $8,500 for complex commercial developments with multiple zones and varied services.

### Can you help with council approval and building permits?
Yes, our engineering documentation is prepared specifically for council approval and building permit applications across all Australian jurisdictions. We produce detailed engineering drawings, specifications, and reports satisfying council requirements and building certifiers' technical assessments. Our structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, and fire safety documentation addresses all relevant NCC provisions and Australian Standards referenced in building applications. For development applications (DAs), we provide concept engineering documentation supporting planning approval including structural approach, site civil works strategy, services infrastructure, and preliminary compliance assessments. For construction certificates (CCs) / building permits, we deliver detailed engineering designs with full calculations and compliance statements. We coordinate with architects, building surveyors (private certifiers), and council officers addressing any technical queries or design conditions. For projects requiring specialized approvals (traffic impact assessments, stormwater detention, WSUD compliance, fire engineering alternative solutions), we prepare supporting technical reports and attend council meetings when required. Our engineers understand varying requirements across Australian councils—Sydney City Council's rigorous commercial building standards, Melbourne's planning permit process, Brisbane City Council's infrastructure design requirements, and regional council expectations. We can also provide design certification and compliance statements where engineers hold appropriate statutory registration (RPEQ in Queensland, NPER in NSW, VBA in Victoria).

### Do you work with BIM (Building Information Modeling)?
Yes, we deliver comprehensive BIM services using Autodesk Revit for structural, civil (Civil3D), mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic disciplines. Our BIM workflows provide 3D coordinated models enabling clash detection, constructability review, quantity takeoffs, and as-built documentation. We produce federated models combining all engineering disciplines with architectural models for comprehensive coordination—identifying clashes between structural beams and HVAC ductwork, electrical conduits and plumbing pipes, architectural ceilings and services—before construction commencement. Recent projects using full BIM delivery reduced construction RFIs by 60-75% and eliminated costly site coordination issues. We follow ISO 19650 information management standards and Australian BIM specifications where projects require specific BIM protocols. Our BIM services include: Revit modeling for structural (concrete, steel, timber framing), MEP services (mechanical, electrical, plumbing), civil infrastructure (Civil3D for roads, drainage, earthworks); Navisworks coordination for clash detection and 4D construction sequencing; custom Revit family development for Australian building products; quantity extraction and cost estimation support; and BIM execution plan (BEP) development. We also provide BIM implementation services for engineering consultancies and construction companies wanting to adopt BIM workflows including template development, standards creation, staff training, and quality procedures. BIM is increasingly standard for Australian commercial projects and government infrastructure, and we're experienced delivering BIM across project sizes from AUD $5M buildings to AUD $200M+ developments.
