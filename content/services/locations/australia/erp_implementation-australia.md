## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which ERP system is best for Australian businesses?

The optimal ERP depends on organization size, industry, and complexity:

- **Industry-Specific** (5%): JD Edwards (mining), Epicor (manufacturing), Infor (distribution).

For Australian businesses, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central offers best value for 10-100 users, while SAP S/4HANA dominates ASX-listed and resource sector companies.

### How do you handle Australian payroll and STP compliance in ERP?

Comprehensive Australian payroll configuration is critical:
- **STP Phase 2 Compliance**: Real-time payroll reporting with disaggregated gross payments, employment conditions (full-time, part-time, casual), and country codes. Direct ATO connection via SBR-enabled software.
- **Award Interpretation**: Configuration of 122+ modern awards including allowances, penalty rates, overtime calculations, and leave accruals. Custom rules for enterprise agreements.
- **Superannuation Processing**: Automated calculation at legislated rates (11.5% currently, 12% from July 2025), electronic payment via SuperStream to APRA funds and SMSFs, quarterly contribution reporting.
- **Tax Calculations**: PAYG withholding per ATO tax tables (updated annually), Medicare levy, HELP/HECS repayments, and study/training support loans.
- **Leave Management**: Annual leave with 17.5% loading, sick/carer's leave, long service leave (varies by state), parental leave, and leave without pay.
- **Fair Work Compliance**: Compliance with National Employment Standards, modern awards, better-off-overall-test (BOOT) for enterprise agreements.
- **State Variations**: Payroll tax thresholds and rates by state, workers compensation premiums by industry and state, and long service leave portability schemes.

We implement SAP HCM, Oracle HCM Cloud, or Dynamics 365 HR with Australian payroll providers (ADP Australia, ELMO Cloud HR, Employment Hero) for comprehensive compliance.

### What's the typical timeline for ERP implementation in Australia?

Australian ERP implementation timelines:
**Business Central (SME)**: 6-12 months
- 2 months: Discovery and design
- 3-5 months: Configuration and data migration
- 2-3 months: Testing and training
- 1 month: Go-live and stabilization

**Mid-Market ERP (Dynamics 365, Oracle Cloud, Small SAP)**: 12-18 months
- 3-4 months: Discovery, design, and planning
- 6-8 months: Configuration, development, integrations
- 3-4 months: Testing, training, and UAT
- 1-2 months: Go-live preparation and hypercare

**Enterprise SAP S/4HANA**: 18-36 months
- 4-8 months: Blueprint and design phase
- 10-16 months: Build, configure, develop, integrate
- 4-8 months: Testing, training, data migration
- 2-4 months: Go-live waves and hypercare

**Multi-Site Rollouts**: Add 3-6 months per additional major location

Australian-specific factors affecting timeline:
- STP and payroll compliance testing adds 4-8 weeks
- Multi-state operations add complexity (varying payroll tax, long service leave)
- Integration with Australian systems (banks, ATO, superannuation)
- Resource availability during Australian holiday periods (Dec-Jan quieter)

Accelerated implementations possible with proven templates, but Australian compliance testing shouldn't be rushed.

### How do you handle ERP implementation across multiple Australian states?

Multi-state implementations require specific considerations:
**State-Specific Compliance**:
- **Payroll Tax**: Different thresholds and rates (NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, ACT, NT)
- **Workers Compensation**: State-based schemes (WorkSafe VIC, icare NSW, WorkCover QLD, etc.)
- **Long Service Leave**: Variations in accrual rates and portability
- **Industrial Relations**: Some states still have state-based awards
- **Environmental**: State EPA reporting requirements differ

**Technical Considerations**:
- Central ERP instance with multi-entity configuration OR separate instances per state
- Data residency requirements (especially government/healthcare)
- Network connectivity across Australian states (AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute)
- Local support presence in key cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth)

**Rollout Strategy**:
- **Big Bang**: All states simultaneously (higher risk, faster ROI)
- **Phased**: One state at a time, typically NSW/VIC first then other states
- **Template Approach**: Configure first site thoroughly, roll out template to others
- **Hub & Spoke**: Head office first, then regional offices

**Change Management**:
- State-specific change champions and super users
- Local training delivery (on-site or remote)
- State business process variations documented
- Time zone considerations for go-live support (AWST, ACST, AEST)

We typically recommend phased approach for Australian multi-state rollouts, starting with largest operations (typically Sydney or Melbourne) to refine processes before rolling to other locations. Timeline: Add 2-3 months per additional state for phased implementations.
