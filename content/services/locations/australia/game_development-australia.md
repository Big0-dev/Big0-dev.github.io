## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to develop a mobile game in Australia?

Development timelines vary significantly based on complexity. A simple hyper-casual mobile game can be developed in 2-3 months, a mid-complexity casual game typically takes 4-8 months, and a complex multiplayer game requires 8-16 months or more. These timelines include concept development, game design, art production, programming, testing, and Australian Classification Board submission. For Australian market success, we recommend additional time for soft launch, testing with Australian players, and iteration based on feedback. Our Australian-based team works in AEST/AEDT timezones for seamless client collaboration throughout development.

### What's the process for getting games classified in Australia?

All games distributed in Australia must be classified by the Classification Board. The process involves: (1) completing application forms with game description and content details, (2) providing gameplay footage or playable demo, (3) submitting screenshots demonstrating highest impact content, (4) paying classification fees (AUD 470 - AUD 2,040 depending on game type), (5) waiting 2-4 weeks for decision (standard applications). Big0 assists clients with classification applications, provides content assessment to predict likely rating, and recommends modifications to achieve target classifications. We have 98% success rate with classification applications and understand Australian content guidelines for violence, themes, language, and online interactivity.

### Can you help access Australian government game development funding?

Yes, we actively assist clients with Australian game development funding applications. We have experience with Screen Australia's Games funding (Expansion Pack up to AUD 500,000, Release up to AUD 150,000), Film Victoria's Assigned Production Investment and Release funding, and other state-based programs. Our services include eligibility assessment, application preparation, budget development, project documentation, pitch materials, and application submission support. We've helped clients secure over AUD 3M in government funding with approximately 40% success rate (above industry average). We also assist with R&D Tax Incentive claims for eligible game development, which can provide 38.5-43.5% refundable tax offsets.

### How do you ensure games succeed in the Australian market?

Our Australian market success strategy includes: (1) Australian player research - understanding preferences, spending behaviors, and cultural nuances, (2) local playtesting with Australian gamers for feedback, (3) Australian themes and cultural references where appropriate, (4) optimization for Australian infrastructure (mobile networks, internet speeds), (5) Australian server hosting for low-latency multiplayer, (6) AUD pricing strategies aligned with local spending power, (7) App Store and Google Play optimization for Australian search terms, (8) partnerships with Australian streamers and content creators, (9) presence at Australian gaming events (PAX Australia, GCAP), (10) understanding of Australian player communities and engagement channels. 85% of our Australian-targeted games achieve top 100 category rankings in Australian app stores.

### What's the difference between Unity and Unreal Engine for Australian game development?

Unity is the most popular engine in Australian game development (used by 60% of studios) due to its accessibility, asset store ecosystem, and excellent mobile support. It's ideal for mobile games, indie PC games, 2D games, and cross-platform development. Unity has lower technical barriers and faster prototyping. Unreal Engine excels at high-fidelity 3D graphics, console development, and AAA production. It's preferred for visually impressive games, console titles, and serious games requiring photorealistic graphics. Unreal's Blueprint visual scripting is designer-friendly. For Australian market context: Unity is perfect for mobile-first strategies (largest AU gaming segment), while Unreal suits premium console/PC titles. We recommend Unity for most Australian indie projects and Unreal for console/high-end PC games. Both engines support all major platforms for Australian releases.

### Do you provide ongoing support and updates after game launch?

Yes, we offer comprehensive post-launch support including bug fixes and technical support (3-6 month warranty period standard), live operations management (content updates, seasonal events, new features), analytics monitoring and optimization (player behavior, retention, monetization), Australian server maintenance and scaling, community management support, platform updates (iOS updates, Android fragmentation, console SDK updates), balance patches and tuning, and additional content development (DLC, expansions, new levels). Most successful Australian games require 12-24 months of active post-launch support for maximum success. We offer monthly retainer packages (AUD 5,000 - 25,000/month depending on scope) or project-based updates. Our longest client relationship is 5+ years of ongoing development for a live multiplayer game with 500,000+ Australian players.

### Can you develop games featuring Australian themes, sports, or culture?

Absolutely! We specialize in authentically Australian game content including Australian sports games (AFL, NRL, cricket, netball, surfing), Australian environments (outback, beaches, Sydney Harbour, Great Barrier Reef, rainforests), Australian wildlife (unique fauna - kangaroos, koalas, wombats, platypus), Australian cultural themes (bush tucker, Indigenous culture with appropriate consultation, urban Australian life), Australian humor and dialogue (authentic voice acting with Australian actors), and historical Australian settings (gold rush, convict era, federation, modern). We engage cultural consultants for sensitive content (Indigenous themes, historical events) to ensure respectful representation. Australian-themed games often perform exceptionally well in domestic market and have unique appeal internationally. We've developed 30+ games with Australian themes achieving strong local and international success.
