# Healthcare IT Solutions Australia | Medical Software & Digital Health Excellence

Australia's healthcare system—combining universal Medicare coverage with private health insurance and world-class clinical care—requires sophisticated digital health solutions that integrate seamlessly with My Health Record, comply with TGA medical device regulations, and support AHPRA-registered practitioners across primary care, specialist medicine, allied health, and hospital settings.

With Australian digital health expenditure reaching AUD $4.8 billion annually and telehealth consultations growing 340% since 2020, healthcare providers need technology partners who understand the complexities of Medicare billing (MBS item numbers), PBS prescription management, private health insurance claiming, and the regulatory landscape governed by TGA, ACSQHC, and RACGP/ACRRM standards.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What TGA compliance is required for healthcare software in Australia?

Healthcare software compliance depends on intended use and risk classification:
**Medical Device Software**: If your software is used for diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease/injury, it's likely a medical device requiring TGA regulation.

**Risk Classification**:
- **Not a Medical Device**: Pure administrative software (appointments, billing, practice management without clinical decisions) - no TGA regulation
- **Class I**: Storage and retrieval of patient data without clinical decision support - self-certification required
- **Class IIa**: Clinical decision support (drug interactions, dosage calculators), diagnostic assistance - conformity assessment by manufacturer
- **Class IIb-III**: Life-supporting, implant programming, autonomous treatment decisions - third-party conformity assessment and TGA approval

**Our Approach**:
1. Early TGA classification determination (often Class I or IIa for most healthcare software)
2. Risk management per ISO 14971 throughout development
3. Clinical evaluation and performance data collection
4. Quality management system implementation
5. ARTG inclusion and post-market surveillance

We guide clients through TGA submission, maintain comprehensive documentation, and ensure ongoing compliance. For Class I-IIa software (90% of healthcare software), process typically adds 8-12 weeks and AUD $30,000-$80,000 to project costs.

### How do you integrate with My Health Record?

My Health Record integration enables Australian patients and healthcare providers to share health information nationally. Integration requirements:
**Conformance Testing**: Your software must pass National E-Health Transition Authority (now ADHA) conformance testing to connect to My Health Record infrastructure.

**Technical Integration**:
- **Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service**: Verify patient Individual Healthcare Identifiers (IHI) and practitioner HPI-I identifiers
- **Document Upload**: Generate HL7 CDA documents (Shared Health Summary, Event Summary, Discharge Summary) and upload to My Health Record
- **Document Retrieval**: Query and retrieve documents from other providers for your patients
- **Secure Messaging**: B2B secure messaging for referrals and reports

**Document Types We Implement**:
- Shared Health Summary (GP summaries)
- Event Summaries (specialist visits, procedures)
- Discharge Summaries (hospital discharge)
- eReferrals and Specialist Letters
- Diagnostic Imaging and Pathology Reports

**Privacy & Consent**:
- Patient consent management per My Health Record Act
- Access controls and restricted documents
- Audit logging of all access

Implementation timeline: 12-16 weeks for initial conformance, AUD $80,000-$180,000 depending on document types and practice software integration complexity. Ongoing maintenance AUD $15,000-$30,000 annually for conformance updates.

### What's involved in Medicare billing integration?

Comprehensive Medicare billing integration includes:
**MBS Item Number Database**:
- Complete Medicare Benefits Schedule with item numbers, descriptions, fees, and rules

- Practice Incentives Program (PIP) data extraction

**API Integration**: We use Medicare's web services (Medicare Online via PKI digital certificate) for real-time claiming. Requires practice to have Medicare Online access, PKI certificate, and proper security controls.

Cost: AUD $35,000-$85,000 for comprehensive Medicare integration including bulk billing, private billing, reporting. Annual maintenance AUD $8,000-$15,000 for MBS updates and API changes.

### How do you ensure patient data security and privacy compliance?

**Technical Security Measures**:
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, single sign-on (SSO) integration
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) - clinicians see only their patients, administrators limited access
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive audit trail of all access to patient records, immutable logs retained 7 years
- **Network Security**: Firewall, intrusion detection, DDoS protection
