Choose native development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) when maximum performance is critical (games, AR/VR, graphics-intensive apps), deep platform integration required (advanced camera, complex sensors, platform-specific features), you want latest platform features immediately upon release, you have established native development teams, or app complexity suits platform-specific approaches maximizing platform capabilities.

Choose cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) when code sharing reduces costs and accelerates delivery (typically 25-40% cost savings), consistent cross-platform experience is desired, standard UI components and features are adequate for requirements, you have limited budget or aggressive timeline, or you want to leverage web development skills (React Native specifically). Modern cross-platform frameworks have matured significantly with major companies like Facebook, Alibaba, Google, and others using them for production apps serving millions of users.

We provide objective guidance evaluating technical requirements, business constraints, and team capabilities to recommend the optimal approach for your specific situation.

### How long does mobile app development take in Australia?

Development timelines vary based on app complexity, features, platforms, and integrations. Simple apps with basic functionality, standard UI, and minimal backend integration typically require 8-14 weeks for single platform or 10-16 weeks for cross-platform development. Medium complexity apps with custom UI, multiple features, backend integration, and payment processing generally need 14-24 weeks for native development or 12-20 weeks for cross-platform.

Complex apps with sophisticated features, real-time functionality, extensive integrations, and advanced security may require 24-40 weeks or more depending on scope. Enterprise apps with complex requirements, multiple integrations, extensive security, and enterprise management features often span 30-52 weeks with phased delivery.

Our agile approach delivers working functionality every 2 weeks enabling early user testing and feedback rather than waiting for complete project delivery. Most clients see initial app versions within 2-3 months with continued enhancement based on user feedback and business priorities.

### What happens after app launch?

App launch represents the beginning of the product lifecycle rather than the end. Post-launch activities ensure ongoing success including warranty period (typically 90 days) addressing bugs or defects discovered after launch, user feedback monitoring from App Store and Google Play reviews identifying issues and enhancement opportunities, analytics and performance monitoring tracking usage patterns, crashes, and performance metrics, and iterative improvement based on data and feedback.

Ongoing maintenance requirements include OS updates ensuring compatibility with new iOS and Android versions (typically annual major releases), security updates addressing emerging threats and vulnerabilities, feature enhancements based on user feedback and business objectives, and performance optimization improving speed and reliability. Most clients engage ongoing support and maintenance retainers providing predictable monthly costs and ensuring apps remain current, secure, and competitive.

App Store Optimization continues post-launch including A/B testing of screenshots, descriptions, and keywords, review management responding to user feedback, seasonal updates for Australian market conditions, and feature updates highlighting new capabilities.

### How do you handle app security and data privacy?

Security and privacy form the foundation of our mobile app development. Technical security controls include encryption of data at rest using iOS Keychain, Android Keystore, and encrypted databases, encryption in transit using TLS 1.3 for all network communications, secure authentication using biometrics, OAuth 2.0, and multi-factor authentication where appropriate, certificate pinning preventing man-in-the-middle attacks, code obfuscation making reverse engineering difficult, and jailbreak/root detection for high-security apps.

Privacy compliance addresses OAIC requirements including privacy by design incorporating privacy from initial architecture, data minimization collecting only necessary information, transparent privacy policies clearly explaining data practices, user consent for data collection and sharing, user control enabling data access, correction, and deletion, and security safeguards protecting personal information. We conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) identifying and mitigating privacy risks.

Security testing throughout development includes static code analysis identifying code vulnerabilities, dynamic testing with running app security testing, penetration testing by security specialists, and dependency scanning for vulnerable third-party libraries. For high-security apps (financial services, healthcare), we engage independent security auditors providing assurance.

### Can you integrate with our existing systems and databases?

Integration with existing systems represents a core competency. We regularly integrate mobile apps with diverse systems including CRM platforms (Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, HubSpot), ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, MYOB), payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Australian banks, BNPL providers), authentication systems (Active Directory, Azure AD, Okta), legacy databases (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL), and custom line-of-business applications.

Integration approaches depend on existing system capabilities. Modern systems with REST APIs enable direct API integration from mobile apps with proper authentication and error handling. Legacy systems may require backend integration layer translating between mobile app requirements and legacy system capabilities. We implement integration best practices including secure API design with authentication and authorization, offline data synchronization for mobile apps, comprehensive error handling and retry logic, caching for performance, and monitoring and alerting for integration health.

Our experience across diverse enterprise technology environments ensures successful integration regardless of existing system constraints.

### How do you handle App Store and Google Play submission?

Successful app store launches require understanding platform guidelines and processes. Our app store expertise includes App Store submission preparing app listing with screenshots, descriptions, keywords optimized for Australian market, creating demo account for Apple review, ensuring compliance with App Review Guidelines, submitting through App Store Connect, and managing review feedback and resubmission if needed. Apple reviews typically complete in 24-48 hours.

Google Play submission involves creating Play Console listing with Australian-focused metadata, preparing preview assets and screenshots, uploading Android App Bundle, running pre-launch testing reports, and publishing to production, beta, or alpha tracks. Google review is typically faster than Apple, often completing within hours. Post-launch management includes monitoring reviews and responding to feedback, tracking analytics and crash reports, releasing updates for bugs and features, and maintaining compliance with evolving platform policies.

We handle complete app store submission process ensuring successful launches and ongoing app store presence management.

### What about app updates and new OS versions?

Mobile operating systems receive major updates annually (iOS typically September, Android various times) requiring app compatibility updates. Our ongoing maintenance includes testing apps with beta versions of new OS releases, updating apps for compatibility and new features, submitting updates before public OS release when possible, and ongoing monitoring for issues after OS releases.

Feature updates and enhancements beyond OS compatibility depend on business requirements and user feedback. Most clients release app updates monthly or quarterly with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. Our agile approach enables rapid feature delivery responding to market changes and competitive pressure. We recommend ongoing development retainers enabling continuous improvement rather than infrequent major updates.
