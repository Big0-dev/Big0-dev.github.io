## Australia's Cybersecurity Landscape

Australia faces increasing cyber threats targeting government, critical infrastructure, and businesses across industries. Understanding the Australian threat landscape and regulatory environment informs effective security strategies.

**Australian Cyber Threat Environment**
The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) reports escalating cyber threats with over 94,000 cybercrime reports in 2023, representing one report every 6 minutes. Significant threats include:

**Ransomware** - Ransomware attacks targeting Australian organizations across all sizes and sectors. High-profile attacks on healthcare, logistics, and government services demonstrate impact. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) lowers barriers enabling less sophisticated attackers. Australian organizations targeted by international ransomware groups seeking financial gain.

**Business Email Compromise (BEC)** - Email scams targeting businesses and individuals through phishing, invoice fraud, CEO fraud, and account takeover. BEC represents the highest-cost cybercrime category with millions in losses annually. Sophisticated social engineering targeting finance and procurement staff.

**Supply Chain Attacks** - Attackers compromising vendors, service providers, and technology suppliers gaining access to downstream organizations. Supply chain attacks enable scaling attacks across multiple victims. Critical for Australian organizations to assess third-party security.

**State-Sponsored Threats** - Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) targeting government, critical infrastructure, research institutions, and defense contractors. Objectives include espionage, intellectual property theft, and strategic intelligence gathering. Attributed threats from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea targeting Australian interests.

**Critical Infrastructure Targeting** - Attacks on energy, telecommunications, water, healthcare, and transport infrastructure. Critical infrastructure attacks pose national security and public safety risks. Increased focus following Security of Critical Infrastructure (SOCI) Act legislation.

**Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)**
The ACSC serves as Australia's national authority on cyber security providing threat intelligence, incident response support, security guidance, and partnership with industry and government. The ACSC publishes the Information Security Manual (ISM) establishing security controls for government, Essential Eight mitigation strategies providing baseline security, threat reports and advisories warning of emerging threats, and incident response support for significant cyber incidents.

Australian organizations benefit from ACSC services including cyber.gov.au guidance and resources, ReportCyber for incident reporting, ACSC Partnership Program for threat intelligence sharing, and security conferences and events.

**Essential Eight Maturity Model**
The Essential Eight represents the ACSC's recommended baseline security controls proven to mitigate cyber security incidents. Originally designed for government, Essential Eight increasingly adopted by private sector as security baseline. The eight mitigation strategies include:

1. **Application Control** - Prevent execution of unauthorized applications through application whitelisting
2. **Patch Applications** - Update applications promptly addressing security vulnerabilities
3. **Configure Microsoft Office Macro Settings** - Disable or restrict macro execution
4. **User Application Hardening** - Configure web browsers and PDF readers to prevent exploitation
5. **Restrict Administrative Privileges** - Limit users with administrative access
6. **Patch Operating Systems** - Update operating systems addressing vulnerabilities
7. **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Implement MFA for all users, especially privileged accounts
8. **Regular Backups** - Implement backup procedures enabling recovery from incidents

Essential Eight defines three maturity levels (Maturity Level One, Two, Three) with increasing security rigor. Our security services help organizations implement and validate Essential Eight controls.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is IRAP and do we need it?

IRAP (Information Security Registered Assessors Program) provides independent security assessment of systems processing Australian Government information. IRAP assessors evaluate systems against Information Security Manual (ISM) controls providing assurance to government stakeholders. You need IRAP if you're an Australian Government agency processing OFFICIAL or higher classified information, contractor or vendor providing services to government agencies, organization in regulated industry where customers require IRAP compliance, or critical infrastructure operator with government security obligations.

IRAP assessments verify security controls appropriate for information classification with different requirements for OFFICIAL versus PROTECTED information. Even if IRAP isn't mandatory, implementing ISM controls provides strong security foundation aligned with Australian best practices. Our IRAP practice helps organizations navigate assessment requirements and achieve certification.

### How does Essential Eight differ from ISO 27001?

Essential Eight and ISO 27001 serve different but complementary purposes. Essential Eight provides baseline security controls proven to mitigate majority of cyber security incidents with eight specific mitigation strategies (application control, patching, macro settings, application hardening, admin privileges, multi-factor authentication, backups). Essential Eight focuses on preventing common attack techniques and is mandatory for Australian Government, increasingly adopted by private sector as security baseline.

ISO 27001 provides comprehensive information security management system (ISMS) framework with hundreds of controls across multiple domains. ISO 27001 emphasizes systematic risk management, continuous improvement, and management commitment. ISO 27001 provides third-party certification demonstrating security maturity.

Many Australian organizations implement Essential Eight as baseline security with ISO 27001 providing broader governance and management framework. The controls complement each other with Essential Eight addressing specific technical controls and ISO 27001 providing organizational security program. We help organizations implement both frameworks in integrated manner avoiding duplication.

### What's involved in APRA CPS 234 compliance?

APRA CPS 234 establishes information security requirements for APRA-regulated entities including banks, insurance companies, and superannuation funds. Compliance requires clear roles and responsibilities with board and senior management accountability, comprehensive information asset register identifying and classifying all information assets, systematic implementation of security controls protecting identified assets, testing of control effectiveness through penetration testing and reviews, incident management with APRA notification for material incidents, and third-party risk management for service providers.

Implementation typically requires 6-12 months for comprehensive program including asset discovery, risk assessment, control implementation, testing and validation, documentation, and reporting. Ongoing compliance requires continuous monitoring, regular testing, annual compliance attestation, and board reporting. While CPS 234 applies specifically to APRA-regulated entities, the framework provides excellent security approach for any financial services organization. Our APRA practice helps organizations achieve and maintain compliance efficiently.

### How long does penetration testing take?

Penetration testing duration depends on scope and complexity. Web application testing typically requires 1-3 weeks for comprehensive assessment including reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and reporting. Simple applications may complete in 1 week while complex applications with extensive functionality require 2-3 weeks. Mobile app testing generally needs 1-2 weeks per platform (iOS and Android separately) for comprehensive security assessment.

Network and infrastructure testing typically requires 1-2 weeks for external testing and 2-3 weeks for combined external and internal testing. Cloud security assessments usually need 1-2 weeks depending on environment size and complexity. Comprehensive multi-domain assessments spanning multiple areas may require 3-6 weeks.

Timeline includes testing execution (60-70% of effort) and report development (30-40% of effort). We provide detailed findings report with executive summary, technical findings, risk ratings, proof-of-concept evidence, and remediation recommendations. Retesting verification of fixes typically requires 2-5 days depending on number of findings.

### What's the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?

Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing serve different purposes in security programs. Vulnerability scanning uses automated tools identifying known vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and infrastructure. Scanning is fast, inexpensive, and scalable enabling frequent scanning (weekly or monthly). However, scanning generates false positives requiring validation, misses business logic and complex vulnerabilities, and doesn't demonstrate actual exploitability or impact.

Penetration testing combines automated scanning with manual testing and exploitation simulating real attacker techniques. Penetration testing validates vulnerabilities are actually exploitable, identifies complex vulnerabilities missed by scanners, demonstrates business impact of successful exploitation, and provides realistic attack simulation. Penetration testing requires more time and cost making it appropriate for quarterly or annual cadence.

Best practice security programs use both approaches: continuous vulnerability scanning providing ongoing visibility with quarterly or annual penetration testing validating security posture and identifying complex issues. We provide both services as part of comprehensive security programs.

### Do you have security cleared personnel?

Yes, our security team includes personnel holding Australian Government security clearances enabling work on sensitive government and defense projects. Our clearance holders include Baseline Vetting for PROTECTED information with validity of 10 years, Negative Vetting Level 1 (NV1) for SECRET information with validity of 10 years, and Negative Vetting Level 2 (NV2) for TOP SECRET information with validity of 7 years.

Security-cleared personnel enable security assessments, penetration testing, and security advisory for government agencies, defense contractors, critical infrastructure operators, and other organizations handling classified information. We maintain sufficient cleared personnel ensuring availability for government projects while supporting clearance sponsorship for additional staff when required.

Cleared personnel maintain security compliance including secure facilities for classified work, approved ICT equipment, security clearance training and awareness, and compliance with security protocols and procedures.

### What incident response services do you provide?

Our incident response services provide expert assistance during security incidents including 24/7 incident response hotline for immediate assistance, rapid triage and severity assessment, initial containment guidance preventing incident spread, forensic investigation determining scope and impact, attacker TTPs identification, evidence preservation for potential legal action, containment and eradication removing attacker access, recovery and validation ensuring clean recovery, post-incident review and lessons learned, remediation recommendations, and security improvement roadmap.

Incident response retainers provide guaranteed response time, priority scheduling, discounted rates, annual security assessment, and quarterly tabletop exercises. Retainers ensure rapid response when incidents occur versus attempting to engage during crisis. For organizations subject to Notifiable Data Breaches scheme, we provide breach assessment, notification assistance, OAIC submission support, and remediation. Our Australian-based incident response team understands Australian regulatory requirements and provides local support.
