## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you handle Fair Work compliance for contractors?

We provide three compliant engagement models: (1) PAYG contractors on Big0's payroll with full tax withholding, superannuation, and workers' comp, (2) genuine independent contractors via their ABN with proper IR35-equivalent assessment to ensure they're not sham contracts, and (3) fixed-term employees for longer engagements. All models comply with Fair Work Act contractor classification tests, ATO personal services income rules, and state payroll tax requirements. We handle all compliance, payroll, and superannuation obligations, protecting clients from contractor misclassification risks that could result in back-pay orders, superannuation penalties, and payroll tax assessments.

### Can you provide security-cleared IT professionals for government projects?

Yes, we maintain Australia's largest commercial pool of security-cleared IT professionals across all clearance levels - Baseline, NV1 (Negative Vetting Level 1), and NV2 (Negative Vetting Level 2). Our cleared professionals have experience with Australian government projects, understand the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), and have worked with agencies like DTA, Services Australia, Defense, and intelligence agencies. We can also sponsor new clearances for Australian citizens, though processing times range from 4-8 weeks (Baseline) to 6-12 months (NV2). Our government practice includes project managers familiar with gateway reviews and ICT procurement processes specific to Australian public sector.

### What are typical timeframes to source and place IT contractors in Australia?

For onshore Australian contractors, our typical timeframes are: junior-mid level roles (1-2 weeks), senior developers and specialists (2-3 weeks), highly specialized roles like security architects or cleared personnel (3-6 weeks). We maintain a database of 15,000+ Australian IT professionals and can often provide shortlisted candidates within 48-72 hours for urgent requirements. For permanent placements, expect 4-6 weeks for mid-level, 8-12 weeks for senior/leadership roles. Offshore augmentation can be faster (3-7 days) as we maintain pre-vetted talent pools in key nearshore locations.

### How do you manage TSS 482 visa sponsorship for international IT workers?

Big0 is an approved TSS sponsor and manages the complete visa process including: Labour Market Testing (mandatory 4-week advertising on JobActive plus two other sources), ANZSCO code mapping and skills assessment, Skilling Australians Fund levy payment (AUD 1,800-3,600 annually), visa application preparation and lodgment, and ongoing sponsorship obligations (training benchmarks, 457/482 register maintenance). Processing typically takes 3-6 months from job offer to visa grant. We sponsor professionals across all ANZSCO occupation codes relevant to IT (261xxx, 262xxx) and provide pathway to permanent residency (ENS 186 visa) after 3 years. Our service includes relocation support, Australian orientation, and family migration assistance.

### What's the cost difference between onshore and offshore augmentation?

Onshore Australian contractors typically cost AUD 600-1,300/day for mid-senior developers in Sydney/Melbourne, while offshore nearshore resources (Philippines, India) cost AUD 250-550/day for equivalent experience. This represents 50-70% cost savings for offshore. However, we recommend hybrid models for best results: Australian-based technical leads and architects (AUD 1,000-1,500/day) with offshore team members (AUD 300-500/day), providing 30-40% overall savings while maintaining quality, Australian business hours coverage, and client-facing roles. Pure offshore models work best for well-defined work packages, while hybrid models suit complex projects requiring frequent client interaction.

### How do Australian IT contractor rates compare across Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane?

Sydney commands the highest IT contractor rates due to concentration of financial services and largest talent market - typically AUD 650-1,300/day for mid-senior developers. Melbourne is 5-10% lower (AUD 600-1,200/day) with slightly less competition but still strong demand. Brisbane is 10-20% lower than Sydney (AUD 550-1,100/day) and represents excellent value as the market matures rapidly. Canberra has unique dynamics - similar to Sydney for general IT but 10-20% premium for security-cleared roles due to government concentration. Perth and Adelaide are 15-25% lower than Sydney. These are general ranges; specific rates depend on skills, experience, and market demand at time of engagement.

### What guarantees do you provide for contractor quality and performance?

We provide comprehensive quality guarantees: (1) 2-week trial period where client can terminate without penalty if contractor doesn't meet expectations, (2) immediate free replacement if performance issues arise after trial period, (3) technical assessment and reference checking before any placement, (4) ongoing performance management and regular check-ins during engagement, (5) Australian-based account management for issue resolution. For permanent placements, we offer 3-6 month replacement guarantee with partial fee refund structure. Our contractor retention rate is 94% beyond 3-month mark, and client satisfaction score is 4.7/5.0, reflecting our rigorous vetting and matching process. We also maintain professional indemnity insurance (AUD 10M) for additional protection.
