## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does web development take in Australia?

Web development timelines vary based on complexity, features, and client availability for feedback. Small business websites with 5-10 pages, template-based design, and standard CMS typically complete in 4-8 weeks including discovery, design, development, testing, and launch. Corporate websites with custom design, 15-30 pages, multiple content types, and integrations generally require 8-16 weeks with comprehensive design process and stakeholder review.

E-commerce websites with product catalog, shopping cart, payment integration, and inventory management typically need 12-20 weeks depending on product complexity and integration requirements. Government websites meeting Digital Service Standard and WCAG 2.2 requirements often require 16-24 weeks including user research, accessibility compliance, and approval processes. Complex web applications with custom functionality, integrations, and sophisticated workflows may span 20-40 weeks with phased delivery.

Our agile approach delivers working functionality early in the project enabling feedback and course correction rather than waiting for complete project delivery. Most projects include regular demonstrations every 2 weeks showing progress and gathering stakeholder input.

### What's the difference between a website and a web application?

Websites primarily deliver information with limited interaction beyond navigation, forms, and content consumption. Typical websites include corporate websites, blogs, brochure sites, and informational portals. Content management systems enable non-technical staff to update content. Websites suit marketing, communication, and information delivery purposes.

Web applications provide interactive functionality enabling users to perform tasks, process data, and manage information. Examples include customer portals, project management tools, booking systems, e-commerce platforms, and business software. Web applications require authentication, databases, complex business logic, and often integrate with other systems. Development complexity and cost typically exceeds traditional websites.

Progressive Web Apps blur this distinction, providing app-like functionality through web browsers including offline operation, push notifications, and home screen installation. PWAs combine website accessibility with application-like capabilities increasingly replacing traditional native apps.

### Do you provide website hosting and maintenance?

Yes, we provide comprehensive hosting and ongoing maintenance ensuring websites remain secure, fast, and up-to-date. Hosting options include managed cloud hosting on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud providing scalability, security, and performance, Australian data center hosting ensuring data sovereignty, content delivery network (CDN) for global performance, automated backups and disaster recovery, SSL certificates and security monitoring, and 99.9%+ uptime SLAs.

Maintenance services include security updates and patches, content updates and changes, performance monitoring and optimization, regular backups and testing, analytics and reporting, compliance monitoring, and ongoing support. Monthly retainers provide predictable costs and ensure websites receive proactive attention rather than reactive repairs.

Many clients prefer our managed services enabling focus on business activities while we handle technical operations. Alternatively, we provide training enabling internal teams to manage websites with our support available when needed.

### How do you ensure websites work well on mobile devices?

Mobile-responsive design forms the foundation of all our web development. Our approach includes mobile-first design starting with smartphone layouts and progressively enhancing for larger screens, responsive grid systems adapting layouts across screen sizes, touch-optimized interfaces with appropriately sized buttons and links, flexible images scaling appropriately for device, and performance optimization for mobile networks.

Testing across devices validates mobile experiences including real device testing on iPhones, Android phones, and tablets, responsive design testing at various screen sizes, touch interaction testing, mobile network simulation testing performance on 3G/4G connections, and cross-browser testing on Mobile Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Progressive enhancement ensures basic functionality for older devices while modern devices receive enhanced experiences. Mobile performance receives particular attention with image optimization, code minification, lazy loading, and caching strategies ensuring fast page loads even on slower mobile connections.

### What about search engine optimization (SEO)?

All our web development incorporates SEO best practices ensuring good organic search visibility. Technical SEO foundations include semantic HTML markup with appropriate headings and structure, meta tags (title, description) optimized for Australian searches, image alt text for accessibility and search engines, XML sitemaps for search engine crawling, robots.txt configuration, structured data (schema.org) enabling rich search results, and mobile-friendliness (Google ranking factor).

Performance optimization improves SEO including page speed optimization (Core Web Vitals), efficient code and compressed assets, image optimization and modern formats, caching strategies, and content delivery network for fast global delivery.

On-page SEO addresses content quality and relevance with keyword research for Australian searches, content addressing user intent and questions, internal linking structure, URL structure and hierarchy, and Australian spelling and terminology. We provide SEO training enabling content teams to maintain and improve search visibility through ongoing content development.

For clients requiring comprehensive SEO, we offer ongoing SEO services including content strategy, link building, technical audits, and competitive analysis driving long-term organic growth.

### Can you integrate with our existing systems and databases?

System integration represents a core competency. We regularly integrate websites and web applications with diverse enterprise systems including CRM platforms (Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics 365, HubSpot), ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, MYOB, Xero), marketing automation (Marketo, Pardot, HubSpot, Mailchimp), e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, shipping and logistics systems, and custom line-of-business applications.

Integration approaches depend on existing system capabilities. Modern systems with REST APIs enable direct API integration with proper authentication and error handling. Legacy systems may require database integration, file-based data exchange, or middleware implementation. We handle integration complexity including data transformation between systems, error handling and retry logic, real-time synchronization or scheduled batch processing, security and authentication, and comprehensive monitoring and alerting.

Our experience across diverse enterprise technology environments ensures successful integration regardless of existing system constraints or technology vintage.

### What accessibility requirements do Australian websites need to meet?

Accessibility requirements vary by sector. Australian Government websites must meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance under Digital Service Standard, use Australian Government Design System patterns, and demonstrate compliance through accessibility statements and testing. State government websites face similar requirements under state-specific policies.

Private sector accessibility requirements depend on industry and organizational policies. While not legally mandated for most private organizations (except where discriminatory), WCAG 2.2 Level AA increasingly represents expected practice. Benefits extend beyond disability access including improved SEO (search engines value accessible markup), better mobile experiences (accessibility and mobile usability overlap significantly), legal risk reduction (discrimination complaints), and increased market reach (20% of Australians have disability).

Our development integrates accessibility from initial design through launch including semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, alternative text for images, accessible forms and interactive components, and testing with assistive technologies. Accessibility addressed during development costs significantly less than retrofitting non-compliant websites.
