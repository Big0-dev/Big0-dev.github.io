## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is cryptocurrency legal in Canada and how is it regulated?

Yes, cryptocurrency is legal in Canada but regulated as securities or money services depending on use case. Key regulations include: (1) Securities Law: Tokens may be securities under provincial securities acts (OSC, AMF, BCSC jurisdiction) requiring prospectus or exemptions; (2) FINTRAC: Crypto businesses must register as Money Services Businesses, implement AML/ATF programs, report suspicious transactions; (3) Tax: CRA treats crypto as commodity, capital gains tax applies; (4) Provincial Differences: Each province has securities regulator with slightly different approaches. We navigate this complex landscape ensuring full compliance.

### How do I register a crypto exchange in Canada?

Registering a crypto exchange involves provincial securities registration and FINTRAC MSB registration: (1) Determine which provinces you'll serve (each requires separate registration); (2) Apply for Crypto Asset Trading Platform registration with provincial regulators (OSC for Ontario, AMF for Quebec, etc.); (3) Meet pre-registration requirements: custody (cold storage, insurance), compliance systems (AML, surveillance), capital (minimum regulatory capital); (4) Register with FINTRAC as MSB; (5) Implement required systems and controls; (6) Undergo regulatory examination before launch. Timeline is typically 8-16 months. We guide clients through this process with legal and technical support.

### Can I launch an ICO or token sale in Canada?

Token sales are heavily regulated in Canada. If your token is a security (most are), you need either: (1) Full prospectus (expensive, time-consuming, ~$500K-$2M cost); (2) Prospectus exemption: Accredited Investor (limit to wealthy investors), Offering Memorandum (disclosure document, retail investors with limits), Crowdfunding (up to $1.5M raise with limits). Most Canadian token projects use Accredited Investor or international sales (excluding Canadians) to avoid full prospectus. Pure utility tokens (rare) may avoid securities laws. We work with securities lawyers to structure compliant token sales and assess classification.

### What blockchain platforms do you recommend for Canadian projects?

Platform choice depends on use case: (1) **DeFi/Public**: Ethereum (largest ecosystem), Polygon (low fees), Arbitrum/Optimism (Ethereum L2); (2) **NFTs**: Ethereum (high-value), Polygon (volume), Solana (gaming); (3) **Enterprise**: Hyperledger Fabric (supply chain, permissioned), R3 Corda (financial services); (4) **High-throughput**: Solana, Avalanche (Canadian-founded); (5) **Canadian Consideration**: Use Canadian node infrastructure (AWS Canada, Azure Canada) for data sovereignty, important for regulated industries and government projects.

### How much does blockchain development cost in Canada?

Blockchain project costs vary significantly:

- **Smart Contract Development**: CAD $15,000 - $75,000 (simple to complex)
- **DeFi Protocol**: CAD $100,000 - $500,000 (AMM, lending, yield vaults)
- **NFT Marketplace**: CAD $75,000 - $250,000 (depends on features)
- **Crypto Exchange**: CAD $300,000 - $1.5M+ (including compliance, security, custody)
- **Enterprise Blockchain**: CAD $200,000 - $2M+ (permissioned network, integrations)
- **Security Audits**: CAD $25,000 - $100,000 per audit

Compliance work (legal, registration) adds significant cost for regulated projects. We provide detailed estimates after understanding requirements.

### Do you handle FINTRAC compliance and AML requirements?

Yes, FINTRAC compliance is core to Canadian crypto projects. Our services include: (1) MSB Registration: Preparing and filing FINTRAC registration; (2) Compliance Program: Designing risk-based AML/ATF compliance program; (3) KYC/AML Systems: Implementing identity verification, screening, monitoring; (4) Blockchain Analytics: Integrating Chainalysis, Elliptic for transaction monitoring; (5) Reporting: Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs), Large Cash Transaction Reports; (6) Training: Staff training on FINTRAC obligations; (7) Ongoing Support: Compliance monitoring, audits, regulatory updates. We partner with compliance consultants and lawyers for comprehensive coverage.

### Can you help with OSC or AMF registration for crypto trading platforms?

Yes, we assist with provincial securities registration for crypto platforms. Our support includes: (1) Registration Strategy: Determining registration category (restricted dealer, investment dealer, marketplace); (2) Pre-Registration Prep: Building required systems (custody, compliance, surveillance, risk management); (3) Application Preparation: Working with securities lawyers on registration applications; (4) System Development: Building compliant trading platform, custody solution, compliance systems; (5) Regulatory Engagement: Supporting regulatory discussions and examinations; (6) Ongoing Compliance: Post-registration compliance monitoring and reporting. We work alongside Canadian securities lawyers who lead legal aspects while we handle technical implementation.
