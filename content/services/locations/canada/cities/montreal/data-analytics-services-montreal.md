## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you ensure PIPEDA compliance in analytics projects?

We implement privacy by design throughout analytics projects. This includes: (1) Data minimization - collecting only necessary data; (2) Purpose limitation - using data only for consented purposes; (3) Anonymization/pseudonymization - protecting identities in analytics datasets; (4) Consent management - tracking and respecting user preferences; (5) Access controls - role-based access with audit trails; (6) Automated data retention/deletion; (7) Privacy Impact Assessments for high-risk projects. We use Canadian data centers (AWS Canada, Azure Canada, GCP Montreal) to maintain data sovereignty and comply with cross-border data transfer requirements.

### Can you handle bilingual analytics for English and French?

Absolutely. Our Montreal-based analytics team creates bilingual dashboards, reports, and data models. This includes: (1) Bilingual dashboard interfaces in Power BI, Tableau, or custom applications; (2) French-language data dictionaries and business glossaries; (3) Bilingual metric definitions and KPI naming; (4) French-Canadian NLP for text analytics and sentiment analysis; (5) Bilingual training and documentation. We understand that Quebec analytics often reveal different patterns than rest-of-Canada, and we design analytics to surface these regional insights while maintaining bilingual accessibility.

### What's your experience with OSFI regulatory reporting?

We have extensive experience building regulatory reporting for Canadian financial institutions. Our team has delivered OSFI reporting solutions including: (1) Basel III capital adequacy (RWA calculations, capital ratios); (2) Liquidity reporting (LCR, NSFR); (3) Stress testing frameworks; (4) IFRS 9 expected credit loss models; (5) Market risk reporting (VaR, stressed VaR); (6) Operational risk reporting. We understand OSFI's data requirements, submission formats, and timelines. Our automated solutions reduce manual effort while improving accuracy and enabling on-time submissions.

### How much do data analytics projects cost in Montreal?

Analytics project costs vary significantly based on scope and complexity:

- **Small Projects** (departmental dashboards, basic reporting): CAD $25,000 - $60,000
- **Medium Projects** (enterprise BI platform, predictive analytics): CAD $75,000 - $200,000
- **Large Projects** (enterprise data warehouse, advanced analytics, ML): CAD $250,000 - $800,000+
- **Ongoing Support**: CAD $5,000 - $50,000/month depending on complexity

Projects requiring bilingual delivery (French/English) typically add 20-30%. Highly regulated industries (financial services, healthcare) may have additional compliance costs. We provide fixed-price proposals after discovery phase.

### Do you use Canadian data centers for data storage?

Yes, we strongly recommend and default to Canadian data centers for data sovereignty and PIPEDA compliance. Options include: (1) AWS Montreal Central (Montreal); (2) Azure Montreal Central (Toronto) and Montreal East (Quebec); (3) Google Cloud Platform Montreal; (4) Snowflake on AWS Montreal Central. Using Canadian data centers ensures your data remains in Montreal, simplifies PIPEDA compliance for cross-border transfers, and meets requirements for regulated industries (financial services, healthcare, government). We can also implement hybrid approaches with data remaining in Montreal while using international services that don't touch personal data.

### Can you work with our existing data warehouse or do we need to rebuild?

We work with existing data infrastructure whenever possible. Most projects involve: (1) Assessment of current data warehouse/lake architecture; (2) Incremental improvements rather than wholesale replacement; (3) Integration with existing systems and tools; (4) Gradual migration strategies for necessary upgrades; (5) Preserving investments in current platforms. Common scenarios include: adding Power BI/Tableau on existing SQL Server/Oracle; migrating on-premises Teradata to cloud Snowflake gradually; building data lake alongside existing warehouse; implementing modern ETL (Fivetran, DBT) with existing infrastructure.

### What industries do you serve for analytics in Montreal?
