## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to develop a mobile app in Montreal?

Development timelines vary based on complexity. A simple app takes 8-12 weeks, a standard business app 12-16 weeks, and complex enterprise applications 16-24+ weeks. This includes discovery, design, development, testing, and app store submission. We follow agile methodology with two-week sprints, providing regular demos throughout development. For apps requiring PIPEDA compliance certification or integration with complex Canadian systems (banking, healthcare), add 2-4 weeks for compliance and integration testing.

### Do you develop bilingual apps for Quebec?

Yes, bilingual app development is one of our specialties. We create apps with full English and French support, including Quebec French localization where needed. Our bilingual apps feature dynamic language switching, culturally appropriate content, proper text expansion handling (French text is typically 20-30% longer), and right-to-left layout support where needed. For apps targeting Quebec primarily, we can develop with French as the primary language. We also ensure compliance with Quebec's Charter of the French Language (Bill 101) requirements for commercial apps.

### How do you ensure PIPEDA compliance in mobile apps?

We build PIPEDA compliance into apps from the ground up through privacy by design principles. This includes data minimization (collecting only necessary information), clear consent mechanisms before data collection, encryption of personal data both at rest and in transit, Canadian data residency options, user rights implementation (access, correction, deletion), and breach detection and response procedures. We conduct privacy impact assessments during development and can help with PIPEDA compliance certification if required. Our apps also consider provincial privacy laws (PIPA in BC/Alberta, PHIPA for Ontario healthcare, Law 25 in Quebec).

### What Canadian payment systems can you integrate?

We integrate all major Canadian payment systems including Interac (e-Transfer, Debit, Flash), Apple Pay and Google Pay with Canadian bank support, Moneris payment gateway, Bambora (Worldline), Square Canada, Stripe Canada, and direct integration with major Canadian banks (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC). For specialized industries, we also integrate cryptocurrency payment systems compliant with FINTRAC regulations and industry-specific payment processors. All payment integrations follow PCI DSS standards and include fraud prevention measures.

### Should I choose native or cross-platform development?

The choice depends on your specific needs. Choose native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) development if you need maximum performance, platform-specific features, complex animations, or extensive device hardware access. Native apps provide the best user experience but cost more to develop and maintain. Choose cross-platform (React Native or Flutter) if you want to share code between iOS and Android (60-90% code reuse), have a limited budget, need faster time-to-market, or have relatively standard app requirements. Cross-platform apps have advanced significantly and are suitable for most business applications. We'll recommend the best approach during discovery based on your requirements, budget, and timeline.

### Where will my app data be stored?

We store app data in Canadian data centers to ensure PIPEDA compliance and data sovereignty. Options include AWS Montreal regions (Montreal, Calgary), Azure Montreal regions (Toronto, Quebec City), Google Cloud Montreal, and IBM Cloud Montreal (Montreal, Toronto). For highly regulated industries like banking and healthcare, we can implement dedicated Canadian hosting environments. All data centers feature redundancy, backup systems, and high availability. We also implement local device caching and offline storage where appropriate, with encryption to protect sensitive data stored on user devices.

### Do you provide app maintenance and updates?

Yes, we offer comprehensive app maintenance and support services. This includes monitoring app performance and server health 24/7, pushing updates for new iOS and Android versions, adding new features based on user feedback, security patches and vulnerability fixes, app store optimization updates, performance optimization based on analytics, bug fixes and issue resolution, and compatibility with new devices. We offer flexible support packages from basic monitoring to full managed services with dedicated development resources. Most clients choose ongoing support to keep their apps current and competitive in the fast-evolving mobile landscape.
