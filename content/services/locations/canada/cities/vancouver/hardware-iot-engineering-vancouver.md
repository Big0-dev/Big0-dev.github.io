## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is ISED and IC certification?

ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, formerly Industry Canada) is the federal department regulating radio equipment in Vancouver. IC (Industry Canada) certification is required for any device that intentionally transmits radio signals - including WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, LoRa, and other wireless technologies. IC certification involves testing your device at an accredited lab for compliance with RSS (Radio Standards Specifications) relevant to your technology, obtaining an IC ID number, and applying IC labeling to your product. Without IC certification, you cannot legally sell or import wireless devices in Vancouver. We guide clients through the entire IC certification process including pre-compliance testing to identify issues early, test lab coordination, documentation preparation, and IC application submission. For devices also sold in the US, we handle combined IC/FCC certification, and for global products, we coordinate CE marking and other international certifications.

### What Canadian cellular networks support IoT devices?

All three major Canadian carriers offer IoT-specific networks. Rogers provides LTE-M (Cat M1) nationwide for mobile, battery-powered applications with moderate data needs, and NB-IoT for stationary, ultra-low-power devices. Bell offers NB-IoT as their primary IoT network technology with excellent coverage, particularly in Quebec and Ontario. Telus provides both LTE-M and NB-IoT with strong Western Vancouver presence. For higher bandwidth applications, all carriers offer standard 4G LTE and emerging 5G IoT. We help clients select the optimal network based on coverage area, data requirements (LTE-M ~1 Mbps, NB-IoT ~250 kbps), power budget (NB-IoT most efficient), mobility requirements (LTE-M better for moving devices), and cost considerations. For remote areas without cellular coverage, we implement satellite connectivity (Iridium, Globalstar) or LoRaWAN with private gateways.

### How do you design IoT devices for Canadian winters?

Designing for Canadian extreme cold requires specific engineering approaches. For temperature operation, we select industrial-grade components rated for -40°C to +85°C (commercial components typically only -20°C to +70°C), design PCBs with appropriate materials handling thermal expansion/contraction, and implement temperature compensation in firmware for sensor accuracy. For battery operation, we use lithium primary cells (tolerating -40°C better than rechargeable), implement battery warming circuits for rechargeable batteries, size batteries accounting for 50%+ capacity loss in extreme cold, and use solar with sufficient battery capacity for short winter days. We select environmental enclosures with appropriate IP ratings (IP65/IP67 typical), use conformal coating on PCBs protecting against condensation, design for thermal expansion/contraction, and include desiccants preventing moisture. Finally, we conduct environmental chamber testing validating operation at -40°C, thermal cycling testing, and real-world winter field testing in Canadian conditions.

### What's the difference between LTE-M and NB-IoT?

LTE-M (Cat M1) and NB-IoT are both cellular IoT technologies optimized for low power and wide area coverage, but with different characteristics. LTE-M provides higher data rates (~1 Mbps down, 375 kbps up), supports mobility (handoff between cells while moving), has lower latency, and includes voice capability. It's best for mobile applications like asset tracking, moderate data needs like daily sensor uploads, and applications requiring lower latency. NB-IoT offers extremely low power consumption (10+ year battery life possible), lower cost modules, excellent deep penetration (basements, underground), but is lower data rate (~250 kbps), higher latency, and no mobility support. It's best for stationary sensors, infrequent small data transmissions, and maximum battery life. In Canada, Rogers has strong LTE-M coverage, while Bell emphasizes NB-IoT. We assess your application requirements around mobility, data rate, latency, battery life, and coverage to recommend the optimal technology.

### Do you support hazardous location certifications for oil & gas?

Yes, we design IoT devices for hazardous locations in oil & gas and other industries. Hazardous location classifications include Class I Division 1 (ignitable concentrations normally present - very rare for IoT), Class I Division 2 (ignitable concentrations not normally present but possible - most oil & gas IoT), and Zone classifications (European system: Zone 0, 1, 2). For Class I Div 2 applications, we implement intrinsically safe design (limiting energy to prevent ignition), explosion-proof enclosures (containing any internal explosion), or purged/pressurized enclosures (keeping hazardous gases out). We design products for certification to CSA standards (C22.2 No. 60079 series), UL standards (UL 60079 series), ATEX (Europe), and IECEx (international). Certification requires specialized testing at facilities like CSA, UL, or TÜV, and costs typically $30,000-$75,000+ per device. Most oil & gas IoT applications require Class I Div 2, which is achievable through proper design. We have experience with certified wellhead monitors, tank level sensors, and pipeline monitoring devices.

### What is LoRaWAN and when should I use it?

LoRaWAN is a low-power wide-area network protocol designed for IoT applications requiring long range (2-15 km rural, 1-5 km urban), very low power consumption (battery life measured in years), low cost (modules $5-$15), and low data rates (0.3-50 kbps). It operates in unlicensed spectrum (915 MHz in North America) so there are no cellular fees, but you need gateway infrastructure. Use LoRaWAN for agriculture (soil sensors, weather stations across large farms), environmental monitoring, smart buildings (hundreds of sensors), industrial IoT with existing site infrastructure, and applications where cellular fees would be prohibitive for many devices. In Canada, The Things Network provides community LoRaWAN in major cities. For larger deployments, we recommend private LoRaWAN with your own gateways providing full control, no ongoing fees, and customized coverage. Don't use LoRaWAN for mobile applications (devices moving between areas), high data rate needs (video, images), low latency requirements, or areas without gateway infrastructure. We assess whether LoRaWAN or cellular IoT better fits your application requirements and economics.

### How do you handle IoT security?

IoT security requires defense in depth across hardware, firmware, communications, and cloud. For device security, we implement secure boot (preventing unauthorized firmware), encrypted firmware storage, hardware security modules (cryptographic keys), secure debug interfaces (disabled in production), and tamper detection where needed. For communication security, we use TLS 1.3 for all cloud communication, certificate-based authentication, encrypted data in transit, and secure key provisioning. For firmware security, we provide signed firmware updates (verifying authenticity), encrypted firmware updates, rollback protection, and secure OTA update mechanisms. For cloud security, we implement device authentication and authorization, API security, encrypted data at rest, access control and audit logging, and regular security audits. We follow OWASP IoT Top 10 security guidelines, conduct threat modeling during design, perform penetration testing, and implement security monitoring and incident response. For PIPEDA compliance, we ensure personal data encryption, consent mechanisms, and Canadian data residency where required.
