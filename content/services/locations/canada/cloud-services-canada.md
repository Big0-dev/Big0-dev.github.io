# Cloud Services Canada | Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure & Migration

Big0 delivers enterprise-grade cloud services across Canada, leveraging Canadian data centers from AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to ensure data sovereignty, regulatory compliance, and optimal performance for Canadian organizations. From Toronto to Montreal and Vancouver, we provide cloud solutions that keep your data in Canada while meeting PIPEDA privacy requirements, industry-specific regulations, and government cloud standards.

Our Canadian cloud practice combines deep expertise in all major cloud platforms with comprehensive understanding of Canadian regulatory requirements, data residency needs, and the unique challenges of serving users across Canada's vast geography and multiple time zones.

## Why Canadian Organizations Choose Big0 for Cloud Services

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should we use Canadian cloud regions instead of US regions?

Canadian cloud regions provide critical benefits: (1) **Data Sovereignty**: Your data remains in Canada, subject to Canadian law; (2) **PIPEDA Compliance**: Simplified compliance when data doesn't cross borders; (3) **Government Requirements**: Federal/provincial mandates often require Canadian data; (4) **Performance**: Lower latency for Canadian users (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver); (5) **Customer Trust**: Canadians prefer their data stored in Canada; (6) **Regulated Industries**: Financial services, healthcare typically require Canadian data residency; (7) **Legal Protection**: Data not subject to US CLOUD Act or other foreign legal access. Canadian regions have slight cost premium (~5-10%) but benefits outweigh for most Canadian organizations.

### How do we ensure PIPEDA compliance in the cloud?

PIPEDA compliance in cloud requires: (1) **Canadian Data Centers**: Store personal information in AWS ca-central-1, Azure Canada Central/East, or GCP Montreal; (2) **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+); (3) **Access Controls**: Role-based access, least privilege, MFA for administrative access; (4) **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all data access; (5) **Data Processing Agreements**: Clear agreements with cloud providers on data handling; (6) **Cross-Border Safeguards**: If data must leave Canada, use Standard Contractual Clauses, encryption; (7) **Breach Response**: Incident response plan including mandatory breach notification; (8) **Privacy by Design**: Build privacy into cloud architecture from the start. We implement PIPEDA-compliant cloud architectures and conduct Privacy Impact Assessments.

### Can we use Azure Government Canada for our workloads?

Azure Government Canada is available for: (1) **Federal Government**: Federal departments and agencies; (2) **Provincial/Municipal**: Provincial and municipal governments; (3) **Crown Corporations**: Government-owned corporations; (4) **Defense Contractors**: Companies doing business with Canadian government; (5) **Regulated Industries**: Some financial services and healthcare requiring enhanced security. Benefits: (1) Physical isolation from commercial Azure; (2) Enhanced security controls for Protected B; (3) Canadian citizen cloud operators with security clearance; (4) Meeting Treasury Board cloud security requirements. If you're eligible, Azure Government Canada provides highest security Canadian cloud. Contact Microsoft for eligibility assessment.

### What's the cost difference between Canadian and US cloud regions?

Canadian cloud regions typically cost 5-15% more than US regions: (1) **Compute**: ~10% premium for EC2/VMs in Canadian regions; (2) **Storage**: ~5% premium for S3/Blob Storage; (3) **Data Transfer**: Similar pricing, but staying in-region is free; (4) **Managed Services**: ~5-10% premium for RDS, managed Kubernetes, etc. However, total cost is often lower because: (1) Reduced data transfer costs (keeping data in one Canadian region); (2) Better performance (lower latency = less over-provisioning); (3) Compliance savings (avoiding complex cross-border compliance). For most Canadian businesses, the data sovereignty and compliance benefits far outweigh the modest cost premium.

### How much does cloud migration cost for Canadian businesses?

Cloud migration costs vary by complexity:

- **Assessment & Strategy**: CAD $25,000 - $150,000 (depends on environment size)
- **Small Migration** (< 50 VMs, < 10 apps): CAD $100,000 - $300,000
- **Medium Migration** (50-200 VMs, 10-50 apps): CAD $300,000 - $1.5M
- **Large Migration** (200+ VMs, 50+ apps): CAD $1.5M - $10M+
- **Ongoing Costs**: Cloud infrastructure typically 20-40% less than on-prem after optimization

Timeline: 3-6 months (small), 6-18 months (medium), 18-36 months (large). Factors affecting cost: complexity of applications, data volume, compliance requirements (OSFI, PHIPA add cost), refactoring vs. rehosting, training needs. We provide detailed migration assessments with fixed-price proposals.

### Do you support multi-cloud across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud in Canada?

Yes, we design and implement multi-cloud architectures using Canadian regions: (1) **Active-Active**: Running production in multiple clouds (AWS ca-central-1 + Azure Canada Central) for maximum resilience; (2) **Active-Passive**: Primary cloud with automatic failover to secondary; (3) **Best-of-Breed**: Using best services from each cloud (AWS for compute, Azure for Windows, GCP for BigQuery); (4) **Workload-Based**: Different applications in different clouds based on requirements. We use Terraform for multi-cloud infrastructure as code, Kubernetes for portable container orchestration, and unified monitoring (Datadog) across all clouds. Multi-cloud provides vendor independence but adds complexity—we help evaluate if it's right for your organization.

### What about disaster recovery between Canadian cloud regions?

DR between Canadian regions is ideal for compliance and performance: (1) **AWS**: Primary in ca-central-1 (Montreal), no second Canadian region currently (use US regions or multi-cloud); (2) **Azure**: Primary in Canada Central (Toronto), DR in Canada East (Quebec)—perfect for Canadian DR; (3) **Google Cloud**: Primary in northamerica-northeast1 (Montreal), DR to northamerica-northeast2 (Toronto) when available, or US regions. Best practices: (1) Automated backup to secondary region; (2) Infrastructure as Code for rapid rebuild; (3) Regular DR testing (quarterly); (4) RTO/RPO defined per application; (5) Runbooks for failover procedures. Azure Canada Central ↔ Canada East is ideal Canadian DR solution, keeping data in Canada even during disasters.
