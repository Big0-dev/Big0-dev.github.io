## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you test bilingual applications for Canada?

We employ native French speakers from Quebec to test French language functionality, ensuring translation accuracy, cultural appropriateness, and proper Quebec French usage (vs. International French). Our bilingual testing process includes verifying all text is properly translated, testing dynamic language switching between English and French, validating UI layouts with longer French text (typically 20-30% longer than English), checking character encoding for accented characters (é, è, ê, ô, ç, etc.), testing date, number, and currency formatting for Canadian French, and validating Quebec compliance requirements where applicable. We use bilingual test data and test cases written in both languages to ensure comprehensive coverage. For Quebec-focused applications, we can test with French as the primary language.

### What Canadian compliance testing do you provide?

Our compliance testing covers all major Canadian regulatory requirements. For PIPEDA (federal privacy law), we validate data encryption, consent mechanisms, data retention/deletion, breach detection, and privacy policy accuracy. For financial services, we test OSFI cyber security requirements, PCI DSS compliance for payment processing, and provincial securities regulations. For healthcare, we validate PHIPA compliance (Ontario), PIPA compliance (BC/Alberta), provincial health system integration, and electronic prescription regulations. We also test accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA, Accessible Canada Act), Quebec's Charter of the French Language (Bill 101), and industry-specific regulations. Our QA team stays current with Canadian regulatory changes and works closely with compliance experts to ensure thorough validation.

### How do you test Canadian payment integrations?

Testing Canadian payment systems requires specialized knowledge of Interac, Canadian banks, and local payment processors. We test Interac e-Transfer (email and mobile transfers), Interac Debit (point-of-sale and online), and Interac Flash (contactless payments) using certified test environments. For credit card processing, we test integration with Canadian processors like Moneris, Bambora, and Chase Paymentech using PCI DSS compliant test procedures. We validate Apple Pay and Google Pay with Canadian bank cards, test direct bank integrations for major Canadian banks (RBC, TD, Scotiabank, BMO, CIBC), and verify cryptocurrency payment processors compliant with FINTRAC regulations. Our testing includes transaction processing, error handling, refunds and chargebacks, fraud detection, security and encryption, and multi-currency handling where applicable.

### Can you test applications requiring security clearance?

Yes, we have QA professionals with Canadian government security clearances ranging from Reliability Status to Secret clearance, enabling us to test applications handling protected government information. We can support testing of federal government applications (Protected B/C data), provincial government systems, defense and security applications, and applications requiring cleared personnel. Our cleared testers understand government security requirements, classification handling procedures, secure development practices, and government-specific testing protocols. For highly classified Top Secret work, we can coordinate with our cleared partners. We maintain appropriate security protocols, use government-approved infrastructure where required, and follow all security guidelines for handling sensitive information during testing.

### How do you test for WCAG accessibility compliance?

Our accessibility testing ensures applications meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards required by Canadian accessibility legislation. We use a combination of automated testing (using tools like axe, Pa11y, WAVE), manual testing with assistive technologies (screen readers like JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack), keyboard-only navigation testing, and color contrast validation. Our testers verify that all functionality is keyboard accessible, images have appropriate alt text, forms have proper labels and error handling, color is not the only visual means of conveying information, text can be resized up to 200%, content has logical heading structure, and links have meaningful text. We test across different assistive technologies and browsers, document all accessibility issues with WCAG success criteria references, and provide remediation guidance for developers.

### What's your approach to test automation?

We follow a strategic approach to test automation that balances ROI with maintenance costs. We start by identifying good automation candidates - stable functionality, repetitive tests, critical user workflows, and regression tests. We recommend against automating frequently changing features, complex edge cases requiring human judgment, or one-time tests. Our automation approach includes selecting appropriate frameworks (Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Appium based on technology), implementing page object model or similar patterns for maintainability, integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines, creating data-driven tests for multiple scenarios, implementing proper waits and synchronization, and maintaining tests as code (version control, code review). We aim for 60-80% automation coverage for stable functionality while maintaining manual testing for exploratory, usability, and complex business logic validation.

### How do you handle testing across different provinces?

Testing for Canadian-wide applications requires understanding provincial variations in regulations, tax rates, business practices, and user expectations. We test provincial tax calculations (HST in Ontario, GST+PST in BC, GST in Alberta, etc.) ensuring accuracy based on customer location and product taxability. For healthcare applications, we validate integration with provincial health systems (OHIP in Ontario, MSP in BC, RAMQ in Quebec, AHS in Alberta) and compliance with provincial privacy laws (PHIPA, PIPA, etc.). We test bilingual requirements specific to Quebec and New Brunswick, validate shipping and delivery with provincial variations, and test region-specific features or content. Our distributed team across Canada can perform testing from different provinces to validate geographic-specific functionality and performance from Canadian networks and locations.
