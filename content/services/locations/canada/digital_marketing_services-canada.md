## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is digital marketing different in Canada vs. the US?

Canadian digital marketing has several unique aspects. Bilingual requirements are significant - Quebec and parts of New Brunswick/Ontario require French content, and many national brands need bilingual marketing. CASL (Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation) is stricter than US CAN-SPAM, requiring express consent for email marketing with serious penalties for violations. We target Google.ca and Bing.ca rather than .com versions, which have different ranking factors and search behavior. Canadian spelling and terminology differs (colour vs. color, etc.) which affects SEO and paid search. The Canadian market is smaller (38M vs. 330M), requiring different budget expectations and market segmentation. Regional differences are pronounced - Quebec markets very differently than Toronto or Calgary, with cultural differences beyond just language. Cross-border considerations matter for Canadian companies selling to US (currency, shipping, advertising compliance) or vice versa. Media costs vary - generally lower than major US markets but higher than US tier-2 cities. Consumer behavior differs in brand loyalty, payment preferences, social media usage, and seasonal patterns. We optimize all campaigns specifically for the Canadian market rather than just adapting US strategies.

### Do we need bilingual digital marketing?

It depends on your target market. You need bilingual marketing if you operate in Quebec (Bill 101 requires French), target francophone customers anywhere in Canada (Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba franco communities), are a national brand serving all Canadians, sell to government (federal government requires bilingual), or want to maximize Canadian market reach (Quebec is 23% of Canadian population). You may not need bilingual if you only operate in English Canada, target English-speaking demographics specifically, are a local business outside Quebec, have limited budget (focus on primary market first), or operate in niche B2B where English is industry standard. Even if not required, bilingual marketing can provide competitive advantages through access to Quebec market (often underserved by English companies), better government relations, enhanced corporate reputation, recruitment in bilingual markets, and differentiation from US competitors. Start with your primary language market, then expand to bilingual when budget and market opportunity justify. For Quebec market specifically, French-first approach is essential - not just translation but true cultural adaptation. We help clients determine if bilingual marketing makes business sense based on target market, growth objectives, budget, and competitive landscape.

### What is CASL and how does it affect my email marketing?

CASL (Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation) is one of the world's strictest anti-spam laws, significantly affecting email marketing. Key requirements include express consent (opt-in) required before sending commercial emails - implied consent is very limited, identification of sender clearly in every email, subject lines must not be misleading or deceptive, unsubscribe mechanism in every email (must process within 10 days), business contact information required, and consent records must be kept for minimum 3 years. Penalties are severe with administrative monetary penalties up to $1M for individuals and $10M for businesses, private right of action allowing individuals to sue, and corporate officers can be personally liable. CASL affects purchased email lists (generally prohibited - can't buy consent), third-party email marketing (sender responsible even if using agency), social media DMs (commercial messages require consent), and text messages (SMS marketing covered). To comply, we implement double opt-in (confirming email address and consent), CASL-compliant opt-in forms (checkboxes not pre-checked), clear consent documentation, easy unsubscribe, regular list cleaning (removing unengaged), and consent record retention. Many email platforms (Mailchimp, Constant Contact, etc.) have CASL features, but you remain responsible for compliance. Violations can result in significant penalties - we've seen enforcement actions for millions of dollars. We ensure all our email marketing services are CASL-compliant from the start.

### How long does it take to see results from digital marketing?

Timelines vary significantly by channel and strategy. SEO (organic search) typically shows initial improvements in 3-4 months with significant results in 6-12 months - SEO is long-term investment that compounds over time. PPC (paid advertising) delivers immediate traffic (within days) with optimization ongoing - expect 2-3 months to optimize campaigns for best performance. Social media shows engagement quickly (weeks) but follower growth and brand awareness takes 3-6+ months, while social advertising works similarly to PPC. Content marketing builds over time - first 3 months establishing foundation, 6-12 months seeing traffic growth, 12+ months seeing significant lead generation. Email marketing gets quick wins (weeks) for promotional campaigns, with automated nurture campaigns optimized over 2-3 months. Conversion rate optimization (CRO) shows results within 1-2 months from testing, with ongoing optimization continuous. Overall program results follow this pattern: Month 1-3 (foundation and setup), Month 4-6 (early results and optimization), Month 7-12 (significant results), Month 12+ (compounding returns). Factors affecting timeline include competition level, budget investment, starting point (brand new vs. existing digital presence), market conditions, and strategy execution. We recommend minimum 6-month commitment for meaningful results and 12+ months for optimal ROI. Digital marketing is not "set it and forget it" - it's continuous optimization and improvement.

### Should we focus on Google or social media advertising?

Both have advantages for different objectives - often best to use both strategically. Google Ads (Search) is best for high purchase intent (people actively searching for solutions), immediate lead generation, local services ("near me" searches), B2B marketing (research phase), and specific product searches. Advantages include high intent traffic, measurable ROI, scalable quickly, and works for most industries. Google Ads typically delivers 30-50% of digital marketing ROI for most businesses. Social media advertising (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok) excels at brand awareness and reach, audience targeting (demographics, interests, behaviors), visual products, B2C e-commerce, retargeting website visitors, and younger demographics. Advantages include precise targeting, lower costs per click, visual storytelling, and social proof. Social media works well for impulse purchases, lifestyle products, and building awareness before purchase intent. Our recommendations vary by business type: B2B companies typically allocate 60-70% to Google Search, 30-40% to LinkedIn and remarketing; E-commerce typically splits 40% Google Shopping, 40% Facebook/Instagram, 20% search; Local services focus 70-80% on Google Search and Local, 20-30% on Facebook; Brand-building campaigns emphasize 60-70% social media, 30-40% Google Display and YouTube. Start with high-intent channels (Google Search for most businesses) then expand to awareness channels (social media) as budget allows. We help determine optimal channel mix based on your business model, target audience, budget, and objectives.

### How do you measure digital marketing ROI?

We measure ROI through comprehensive tracking and attribution. First, we define goals and KPIs including revenue and sales, leads and conversions, website traffic and engagement, brand awareness metrics, customer lifetime value, and return on ad spend (ROAS). We implement tracking including Google Analytics 4 (GA4), conversion tracking pixels, call tracking, CRM integration, e-commerce tracking, and multi-touch attribution. Key metrics we track are cost per acquisition (CPA) - cost to acquire a customer, return on ad spend (ROAS) - revenue per dollar spent on ads, customer lifetime value (CLV) - total value of customer relationship, conversion rate - percentage of visitors who convert, and overall marketing ROI - (revenue - marketing cost) / marketing cost. Attribution models we use include last-click attribution (credit to final touchpoint), first-click (credit to first touchpoint), linear (equal credit to all touchpoints), time-decay (more credit to recent touchpoints), and data-driven attribution (algorithmic credit assignment). We provide reporting including monthly performance reports, campaign analytics, channel performance comparison, ROI and ROAS by channel, conversion funnel analysis, and recommendations for optimization. For most clients, we track both immediate ROI (sales this month from this month's marketing) and long-term ROI (customer lifetime value, brand equity, organic ranking improvements). Digital marketing ROI typically improves over time as we optimize campaigns, build organic rankings, and better understand your customer journey. We provide transparent reporting showing exactly where your budget goes and what results it generates.

### Can you help with French Canadian (Quebec) marketing?

Yes, Quebec marketing is one of our specialties with native French speakers from Quebec on our team. Our Quebec marketing services include French-first content strategy (not just translations), Quebec French copywriting (not European French), cultural adaptation (beyond language), Quebec-specific SEO (different keywords and search behavior), French social media marketing, Quebec influencer partnerships, Montreal/Quebec City/Laval local marketing, and Bill 101 compliance (Charter of French Language). Key Quebec marketing differences from English Canada include language is identity (using proper Quebec French essential), cultural pride and distinct identity, strong local business preference, Facebook dominant platform, different humor and messaging styles, family-oriented values, and sensitivity to language politics. Common mistakes to avoid are using European French (sounds foreign to Quebecers), direct English translation (misses cultural nuance), treating Quebec as afterthought (needs same investment as English), Toronto-centric messaging (alienates Quebec), ignoring Quebec holidays (Saint-Jean-Baptiste, etc.), and English-first approach (violates Bill 101, reduces effectiveness). We develop Quebec marketing strategies that respect cultural identity, use authentic Quebec French, leverage local insights and influencers, optimize for Quebec platforms and search behavior, and meet legal requirements. Quebec represents 23% of Canadian population and a distinct market opportunity - done right, Quebec marketing delivers strong ROI and builds lasting customer relationships. We help English-Canadian and international companies successfully enter and grow in the Quebec market.
