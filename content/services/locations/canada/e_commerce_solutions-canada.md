## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which e-commerce platform is best for Canadian retailers?

For most Canadian retailers, Shopify is the best choice. It's a Canadian company (Ottawa-based) with excellent understanding of the Canadian market, built-in support for CAD currency and Canadian payment processors, easy integration with Canadian shipping carriers (Canada Post, Purolator), simple bilingual setup for English/French stores, and reasonable pricing with minimal technical requirements. Shopify powers over 60% of Canadian e-commerce sites. However, alternatives make sense in specific cases: WooCommerce if you need heavy content marketing integration, Magento for complex enterprise B2B requirements, or custom-built for unique business models that platforms can't support. We assess your specific needs, budget, technical resources, and business model to recommend the best fit.

### How do you handle bilingual e-commerce for Canada?

Creating effective bilingual e-commerce requires more than simple translation. We implement separate URLs for English and French (e.g., /products vs. /produits) for better SEO on Google.ca, automatic language detection based on browser settings with manual switching option, complete translation of all content including product descriptions, policies, emails, checkout process, and navigation. We handle text expansion (French text is typically 20-30% longer), ensuring layouts work for both languages. For Quebec-focused stores, we implement French as the default language meeting Bill 101 requirements. We use professional translation services ensuring accurate, culturally appropriate Quebec French (not just European French), and maintain content parity ensuring new products and content are available in both languages simultaneously.

### How do you handle HST/GST/PST tax calculation?

Canadian tax calculation is complex due to provincial variations. We configure e-commerce platforms to correctly calculate HST (13-15%) in Ontario, NB, NS, PEI, and Newfoundland, GST (5%) in all provinces, PST (6-7%) in BC, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba separately from GST, QST (9.975%) in Quebec in addition to GST, and no provincial tax in Alberta (GST only). We implement tax rules for exempt products (groceries, children's clothing under $100, medical devices, etc.), handle B2B tax exemptions with proper documentation, set up tax for digital products following CRA guidelines, and configure nexus rules for out-of-province sales. For complex scenarios, we integrate tax automation platforms like Avalara or TaxJar that automatically update rates and rules. We also provide guidance on tax remittance and filing requirements.

### Can you integrate with Canadian shipping carriers?

Yes, we integrate all major Canadian shipping carriers. For Canada Post, we implement real-time rate calculation based on weight, dimensions, and destination, label printing and tracking, domestic (regular, expedited, express) and international options, Xpresspost and Priority services, and SmartFlow integration for high-volume shippers. For Purolator, we integrate ground and express services, real-time tracking, packaging options, and dangerous goods handling. We also integrate cross-border carriers (FedEx, UPS, DHL) for international shipping, regional carriers (Canpar, Loomis), and fulfillment centers (ShipBob, Amazon FBA, Shopify Fulfillment Network). For multi-carrier setups, we implement comparison at checkout showing customers the best options, and integrate ShipStation or Easyship for centralized shipping management across multiple carriers.

### What payment options should Canadian stores offer?

Canadian shoppers expect multiple payment options. At minimum, we recommend implementing major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Shopify Payments or Moneris (Canada's leading processors), and PayPal (widely trusted in Canada). For increased conversion, add Interac Debit (preferred by many Canadians over credit cards), Apple Pay and Google Pay (fast, secure mobile checkout), and Interac e-Transfer (popular for peer-to-peer and bill payments). For higher-value items, consider buy-now-pay-later options like Klarna, Affirm, or Sezzle (growing in Canada). For niche markets, cryptocurrency payments may be relevant. We configure payment gateways for optimal Canadian rates, minimal fees, fast settlement, and fraud protection, ensuring secure, PCI-compliant payment processing meeting customer expectations for safety and convenience.

### How long does it take to build an e-commerce store?

Timelines vary significantly based on platform and complexity. A basic Shopify store with a customized theme, 50-100 products, and standard features takes 4-6 weeks. A custom Shopify theme with unique design and advanced features takes 8-12 weeks. Shopify Plus enterprise implementation with complex integrations takes 12-20 weeks. WooCommerce development similar to Shopify timeline (6-10 weeks). Custom-built e-commerce platforms take 4-12+ months depending on complexity. Factors affecting timeline include product catalog size and complexity, custom design requirements, integrations needed (ERP, POS, CRM, etc.), bilingual requirements, custom features and functionality, and content preparation (products, images, descriptions). We provide detailed project plans with milestones and can adjust timelines based on your launch requirements.

### Do you provide ongoing support after launch?

Yes, e-commerce is never "done" - it requires continuous optimization and support. We offer flexible ongoing support packages including platform maintenance (updates, security patches, bug fixes), feature enhancements based on customer feedback and analytics, conversion rate optimization through A/B testing and UX improvements, performance monitoring and optimization, app updates and new integrations, seasonal campaign support (Black Friday, holidays), security monitoring, and priority support for urgent issues. Support packages range from CAD $1,000/month for basic maintenance to $10,000+/month for comprehensive optimization and growth services. Most clients benefit from at least 3-6 months of intensive post-launch optimization to refine the store based on real customer data, followed by ongoing monthly support. We also provide training so your team can handle day-to-day operations while we focus on strategic improvements.
