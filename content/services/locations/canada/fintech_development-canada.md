## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do we obtain OSFI approval for a digital bank in Canada?

Obtaining federal bank charter from OSFI is rigorous: (1) **Business Plan**: Comprehensive 3-5 year plan including financials, technology, risk management; (2) **Capital**: Minimum $10M+ capital (more for meaningful operations); (3) **Management**: Experienced senior management team with Canadian banking experience; (4) **Governance**: Strong board of directors with financial expertise; (5) **Systems**: Robust banking systems, AML/ATF, cybersecurity; (6) **Application**: Formal application to OSFI with extensive documentation; (7) **Review**: 12-18 month review process with OSFI questions and revisions. Alternative: Partner with existing bank or obtain provincial trust license (less capital, faster). We guide clients through this process working with regulatory lawyers.

### What are the requirements to operate a payment gateway in Canada?

Payment gateway requirements depend on your model: (1) **If touching funds**: FINTRAC MSB registration, AML/ATF program, transaction monitoring, STR filing; (2) **PCI DSS Compliance**: Level 1 if processing 6M+ transactions annually, otherwise Level 2-4; (3) **Merchant Agreements**: Contracts with acquiring banks (Moneris, Chase, Global Payments); (4) **Provincial Registration**: Some provinces require money transmitter licenses; (5) **Insurance**: Errors & omissions, cyber liability insurance; (6) **Privacy**: PIPEDA compliance for merchant and consumer data. If pure technology provider (not touching funds), requirements are lighter. We implement compliant payment infrastructure and guide regulatory process.

### How do we comply with FINTRAC for our fintech platform?

FINTRAC compliance involves: (1) **Determine if MSB**: If exchanging currency, transmitting funds, dealing in virtual currency → you're MSB; (2) **Register with FINTRAC**: Initial registration and renewal every 2 years; (3) **Compliance Program**: Risk assessment, policies/procedures, training, effectiveness review; (4) **KYC**: Verify identity of all customers, maintain client information records; (5) **Ongoing Monitoring**: Monitor transactions for suspicious activity; (6) **Reporting**: File STRs (suspicious), LCTRs (large cash $10K+), EFTRs (international $10K+); (7) **Record Keeping**: Maintain records for 5+ years; (8) **PEP Screening**: Enhanced due diligence for politically exposed persons. We implement FINTRAC-compliant systems including transaction monitoring, reporting, case management.

### Can we use open banking data for credit decisioning in Canada?

Currently, open banking doesn't officially exist in Canada, but alternatives work: (1) **Bank Account Verification**: Services like Flinks, Plaid use screen scraping or bank partnerships to access account data with user consent; (2) **Credit Bureaus**: Equifax, TransUnion provide tradeline data with consumer consent; (3) **Alternative Data**: Utility bills, rent payments, employment data (with consent); (4) **PIPEDA Compliance**: Must have meaningful consent, use data only for stated purpose, protect privacy. When Canadian open banking launches (expected 2024-2025), standardized APIs will enable read access to bank data with customer consent. We implement current best practices and design for future open banking APIs.

### How much does fintech development cost in Canada?
