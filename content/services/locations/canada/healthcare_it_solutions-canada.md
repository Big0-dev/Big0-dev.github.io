## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between PIPEDA, PHIPA, and PIPA?

PIPEDA is Canada's federal privacy law applying to private sector organizations in provinces without substantially similar provincial legislation. PHIPA is Ontario's health-specific privacy law applying to all "health information custodians" (hospitals, doctors, labs, pharmacies, etc.) in Ontario - it's more stringent than PIPEDA with specific health sector requirements like the "circle of care" concept and lockbox provisions. PIPA exists in both BC and Alberta as provincial private sector privacy laws, applying to health information held by private healthcare organizations. Quebec has its own privacy law (Law 25 and previous legislation) with health-specific provisions. The key difference is PHIPA is health-specific and comprehensive, while PIPEDA and PIPA are general privacy laws that include health information. Our healthcare applications implement the strictest applicable standard ensuring compliance regardless of jurisdiction.

### How do you integrate with provincial health insurance systems?

Each province has unique billing systems and requirements. For OHIP (Ontario), we integrate with OHIP's electronic claims submission system, implement service codes and billing rules, handle premium calculations and adjustments, support reconciliation files and remittance advice, and track pending claims and rejections. For MSP BC, we integrate with the BC Medical Services Plan billing system with similar claim submission and tracking. For RAMQ (Quebec), we implement bilingual billing integration with Quebec-specific codes and requirements. For other provinces, we follow their specific integration requirements. We handle complex billing scenarios including third-party billing, WorkSafeBC/WSIB claims, out-of-province billing, and private pay billing. Our billing modules ensure maximum claim accuracy, minimal rejections, and efficient revenue cycle management.

### Can your healthcare solutions work across multiple provinces?

Yes, we design healthcare solutions to work across provincial boundaries while respecting provincial differences. We implement multi-provincial billing supporting different provincial billing systems, provincial privacy law compliance (PHIPA, PIPA, PIPEDA), bilingual support for Quebec and other francophone markets, provincial health information exchange integration where applicable, and configurable workflows accommodating provincial practice differences. For example, a telemedicine platform might support OHIP, MSP, RAMQ, and AHS billing while maintaining appropriate privacy compliance for each province. We handle complexities like out-of-province billing, inter-provincial referrals, and varying prescription regulations. This is valuable for multi-provincial healthcare organizations, telemedicine providers serving multiple provinces, and health tech startups wanting Canadian-wide market access.

### What healthcare interoperability standards do you support?

We implement all major healthcare interoperability standards. For HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), we build RESTful API integrations supporting patient demographics, observations (vitals, labs), diagnostic reports, medications and allergies, immunizations, appointments, and care plans. For HL7 v2.x (legacy standard still widely used), we support ADT messages (admissions, discharges, transfers), ORM/ORU (orders and results), SIU (scheduling), and DFT (billing). We integrate DICOM for medical imaging (PACS integration, imaging workflow), IHE profiles for specific use cases (XDS for document sharing, PIX/PDQ for patient identity), and CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) for clinical documents. We align with Canada Health Infoway standards and pan-Canadian interoperability initiatives. Our implementations undergo rigorous testing including Connectathon participation where applicable.

### How long does it take to implement a healthcare IT system?

Implementation timelines vary significantly based on scope and complexity. A patient portal for an existing EMR takes 4-6 months (design, development, testing, training, rollout). A small practice EMR (1-5 physicians) takes 6-9 months. A multi-physician practice EMR (6-20 physicians) takes 9-12 months. A telemedicine platform takes 6-10 months. Hospital department system takes 12-18 months. Enterprise hospital information system takes 24-36+ months with phased implementation. Factors affecting timeline include clinical workflow complexity, number of integrations required, data migration from legacy systems, change management and training needs, and regulatory compliance requirements. Healthcare implementations can't be rushed - patient safety, clinician training, and workflow validation require adequate time. We provide realistic timelines with phased approaches allowing incremental value delivery while managing risk.

### Do you provide training for healthcare staff?

Comprehensive training is critical for successful healthcare IT implementation. We provide role-based training programs including physician training (clinical workflows, documentation, order entry, decision support), nursing training (medication administration, care planning, bedside workflows), administrative training (scheduling, billing, registration), pharmacy training, and laboratory training. Training methods include classroom training, hands-on workshops with test systems, one-on-one training for physicians (often most effective), e-learning modules for flexible learning, quick reference guides and job aids, super-user training (staff who provide peer support), and go-live support with at-the-elbow assistance. We customize training to each organization's needs, clinical specialties, and technology proficiency levels. Post-implementation, we provide ongoing education for new staff, system updates, and optimization opportunities.

### What happens if there's a privacy breach?

Healthcare privacy breaches are serious events requiring immediate response. Our systems include breach detection capabilities through audit log monitoring, anomalous access pattern detection, failed login attempt tracking, and bulk data export alerts. When a breach is detected or suspected, we follow established breach response procedures: immediate containment to prevent further unauthorized access, investigation to determine scope (what data, how many patients, how accessed), risk assessment of potential harm to patients, notification to privacy officer and executive leadership, documentation of breach details and response, and remediation to prevent recurrence. Legal notification requirements vary by province - PHIPA in Ontario requires notification to Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals if real risk of significant harm, PIPEDA federally has similar requirements, and provincial laws vary. We help organizations develop breach response plans, conduct tabletop exercises, and provide technical tools for rapid breach detection and response. Prevention is best - our security controls, access logging, and monitoring minimize breach risk.
