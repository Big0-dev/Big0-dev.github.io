## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is PIPEDA and how does it affect cybersecurity?

PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is Canada's federal privacy law governing how private sector organizations handle personal information. It significantly impacts cybersecurity through its requirements for safeguarding personal information. Organizations must implement security appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, which typically includes encryption, access controls, network security, and security monitoring. PIPEDA also requires breach notification - organizations must report breaches of security safeguards involving personal information to the Privacy Commissioner, affected individuals, and other organizations if there's a real risk of significant harm. Our cybersecurity services ensure your technical and administrative controls meet PIPEDA's security safeguard requirements.

### What are CCCS baseline cyber security controls?

The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) publishes Baseline Cyber Security Controls for small and medium organizations, identifying the minimum security controls needed to protect against common threats. These controls cover areas like patch management (keeping systems updated), configuration management (secure system settings), administrative privileges (limiting high-level access), cloud security, and incident response. While not legally mandated for most organizations, these controls represent best practices aligned with government expectations. We help organizations implement CCCS baseline controls and can progress to more advanced security frameworks like ITSG-33 for organizations needing higher security levels or working with government.

### How does OSFI's Cyber Security Self-Assessment work?

OSFI's Cyber Security Self-Assessment is a regulatory requirement for federally regulated financial institutions (banks, credit unions, insurance companies). Institutions must annually assess their cybersecurity maturity across six key areas: inherent cyber risk, cybersecurity management, threat and vulnerability management, security monitoring and testing, incident response, and third-party risk management. Each area is rated on a five-level maturity scale. The assessment includes quantitative metrics (security incidents, time to patch, etc.) and qualitative assessments. Results must be reviewed by the board and senior management. We assist financial institutions with OSFI self-assessments through gap analysis, control implementation, evidence collection, and executive reporting, ensuring you meet OSFI's expectations and demonstrate continuous improvement.

### What's the difference between PIPEDA and provincial privacy laws?

PIPEDA is federal law applying to private sector organizations across Canada, except in provinces with substantially similar legislation. Quebec has Law 25 (modernized privacy law), Alberta has PIPA (Personal Information Protection Act), and British Columbia has PIPA. These provincial laws apply instead of PIPEDA for organizations within those provinces. Key differences include Quebec's Law 25 has stricter consent requirements and mandatory privacy impact assessments, provincial laws may have different breach notification thresholds, and some requirements are more prescriptive. For healthcare, Ontario's PHIPA and other provincial health privacy laws govern health information separately. We assess which laws apply to your organization and ensure compliance with all applicable federal and provincial requirements.

### Do you have security clearances for government work?

Yes, our team includes security professionals with Canadian government security clearances ranging from Reliability Status to Secret clearance. We can support federal departments and agencies working with Protected B and Protected C information, assist with implementation of ITSG-33 security controls, support GC Cloud initiatives (Canadian cloud security), and work with organizations requiring security clearances for their staff. For highly classified work requiring Top Secret clearance, we can coordinate with our cleared partners or support your cleared staff. Our experience with Government of Canada security requirements ensures we understand the unique challenges of public sector cybersecurity.

### How quickly can you respond to a security incident?

For clients with managed security services or incident response retainers, we provide 24/7/365 incident response with initial response within 1 hour for critical incidents and 4 hours for high-priority incidents. Our Canadian SOC monitors continuously and can immediately begin investigation and containment. For organizations without existing relationships, we offer emergency incident response services and can typically have a team on-site or working remotely within 4-8 hours depending on location and severity. Our incident response includes containment to stop the attack, investigation to understand scope and impact, eradication to remove attacker access, recovery to restore operations, and post-incident reporting and recommendations. We recommend all organizations establish incident response retainers before incidents occur to ensure fastest possible response.

### What cybersecurity certifications does your team hold?

Our cybersecurity team holds comprehensive industry certifications including offensive security certifications (OSCP - Offensive Security Certified Professional, GPEN - GIAC Penetration Tester, CEH - Certified Ethical Hacker), defensive security certifications (CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional, CISM - Certified Information Security Manager, GIAC Security Essentials), cloud security (AWS Certified Security Specialty, Azure Security Engineer, Google Cloud Security), compliance and audit (CISA - Certified Information Systems Auditor, QSA - PCI DSS Qualified Security Assessor, ISO 27001 Lead Auditor), and Canadian-specific expertise in PIPEDA compliance, OSFI requirements, and CCCS frameworks. We maintain continuous education and participate in Canadian cybersecurity communities including CCCS partnerships and industry ISACs.
