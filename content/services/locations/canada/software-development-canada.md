Canadian developer rates: CAD $80-200/hour depending on seniority and specialization. We provide fixed-price proposals after detailed discovery phase, or time-and-materials for evolving requirements.

### Do you provide ongoing support and maintenance after launch?

Yes, comprehensive post-launch support is crucial: (1) **Support Tiers**: Different SLA levels (8x5, 24x7) based on criticality; (2) **Bug Fixes**: Rapid response to production issues; (3) **Performance Monitoring**: Proactive monitoring and optimization; (4) **Security Patches**: Regular security updates and dependency management; (5) **Feature Enhancements**: Ongoing feature development based on user feedback; (6) **Bilingual Support**: Support in English and French; (7) **Canadian Coverage**: Support teams in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver covering all time zones. Typical support costs 15-25% of development cost annually. We offer managed services including infrastructure management, DevOps, and 24x7 operations.

### Can you help with Scientific Research & Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax credits?

Yes, we structure development to maximize SR&ED eligibility: (1) **SR&ED-Eligible Work**: Identifying technological uncertainties and experimental development; (2) **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation required for SR&ED claims; (3) **Time Tracking**: Detailed time tracking for eligible development activities; (4) **Technical Reports**: Preparing technical narratives explaining R&D activities; (5) **CRA Compliance**: Following CRA guidelines for SR&ED claims; (6) **Qualified Activities**: Focus on technological advancement, not routine development. Many of our Canadian clients claim 30-50% of development costs through SR&ED, effectively reducing project costs. We work with SR&ED consultants to maximize claims while maintaining development efficiency.
