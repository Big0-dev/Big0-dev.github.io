## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you develop VR applications for NHS healthcare settings?
Yes, we specialize in NHS-compliant VR healthcare applications. Our healthcare VR services include surgical simulation for medical training, therapeutic VR for mental health (anxiety, PTSD, phobias), patient education for pre-operative preparation and health conditions, and rehabilitation programs for stroke recovery and physiotherapy. All healthcare VR meets NHS Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) including clinical safety standards (DCB 0129, DCB 0160), data protection requirements, and interoperability standards. We conduct clinical validation studies, work with NHS innovation teams, and ensure MHRA medical device compliance where required. Our NHS VR projects range from £40,000-£300,000 depending on clinical complexity and regulatory requirements.

### What VR training solutions work for UK manufacturing and construction?
Our UK industrial VR training simulations cover dangerous equipment operation (forklifts, cranes, industrial robots, CNC machines) without real-world risk, confined space and height work training meeting UK regulations, emergency response and evacuation procedures, hazardous materials handling following HSE guidelines, and CDM Regulations compliance for construction. VR training reduces costs by 40-60% compared to traditional training while improving knowledge retention (75% vs 10% for lectures) and safety outcomes. We integrate with UK training providers, provide CPD-certified programs, and support competency tracking. Industrial VR training projects cost £40,000-£150,000 depending on complexity and number of training modules required.

### How can UK retailers use AR to reduce returns and increase sales?
UK retail AR applications include virtual try-on for fashion, eyewear, and jewelry allowing customers to visualize products before purchase, furniture and home décor AR showing items in actual UK homes at accurate scale, beauty and cosmetics try-on (makeup, hair color) popular with UK consumers, and vehicle configurators for automotive retail. AR shopping increases conversion rates by 30-40% and reduces returns by 25% (major cost for UK e-commerce). We integrate AR into existing UK e-commerce platforms (Shopify UK, WooCommerce, Magento), optimize for British mobile devices, and ensure GDPR compliance. Retail AR projects range from £25,000-£120,000 depending on product complexity and integration requirements.

### What's the ROI timeline for UK business VR/AR investments?
ROI timelines vary by application but UK businesses typically see: VR training ROI in 6-18 months through reduced training costs, fewer accidents, and faster competency development (manufacturing/construction typically 12-month payback), retail AR ROI in 3-12 months from increased conversion and reduced returns (furniture AR pays back quickly), healthcare VR ROI in 12-24 months from improved patient outcomes and reduced equipment needs, and architectural VR ROI in 6-12 months accelerating sales and reducing physical marketing. Example: UK manufacturer spending £80,000 on VR training saves £60,000 annually on training costs and £40,000 from reduced accidents, achieving 10-month payback and 125% first-year ROI.
