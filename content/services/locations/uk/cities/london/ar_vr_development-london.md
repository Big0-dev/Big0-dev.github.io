## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you develop VR applications for NHS healthcare settings?
Yes, we specialize in NHS-compliant VR healthcare applications. Our healthcare VR services include surgical simulation for medical training, therapeutic VR for mental health (anxiety, PTSD, phobias), patient education for pre-operative preparation and health conditions, and rehabilitation programs for stroke recovery and physiotherapy. All healthcare VR meets NHS Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC) including clinical safety standards (DCB 0129, DCB 0160), data protection requirements, and interoperability standards. We conduct clinical validation studies, work with NHS innovation teams, and ensure MHRA medical device compliance where required. Our NHS VR projects range from £40,000-£300,000 depending on clinical complexity and regulatory requirements.

### What VR training solutions work for London manufacturing and construction?
Our London industrial VR training simulations cover dangerous equipment operation (forklifts, cranes, industrial robots, CNC machines) without real-world risk, confined space and height work training meeting London regulations, emergency response and evacuation procedures, hazardous materials handling following HSE guidelines, and CDM Regulations compliance for construction. VR training reduces costs by 40-60% compared to traditional training while improving knowledge retention (75% vs 10% for lectures) and safety outcomes. We integrate with London training providers, provide CPD-certified programs, and support competency tracking. Industrial VR training projects cost £40,000-£150,000 depending on complexity and number of training modules required.
