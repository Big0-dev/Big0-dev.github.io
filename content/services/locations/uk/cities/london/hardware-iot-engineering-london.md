## Frequently Asked Questions

### What IoT connectivity works best in London?

Cellular IoT (4G/5G/NB-IoT) provides the most reliable connectivity across London with excellent coverage from EE, Vodafone, O2, and Three. For static applications requiring 10-year battery life, NB-IoT is ideal. For applications requiring higher bandwidth or video, 4G/5G is necessary. LoRaWAN works well for low-bandwidth applications across most of London with community (The Things Network) or commercial networks available. WiFi is suitable for indoor applications in buildings with existing WiFi infrastructure. Cost ranges from £1-5/month for LoRaWAN to £3-15/month for cellular depending on data usage.

### How long does UKCA certification take for IoT devices?

UKCA certification for IoT devices typically takes 8-16 weeks depending on device complexity and testing requirements. Simple devices (e.g., LoRaWAN sensors) can achieve certification in 8-10 weeks, while complex devices with cellular radios, WiFi, and Bluetooth may require 12-16 weeks. Pre-compliance testing at your development facility can reduce timelines by identifying issues early. Working with experienced UK test houses (BSI, Intertek, SGS UK) in parallel with development optimizes schedules. Budget £15,000-40,000 for certification depending on number of radio protocols and required testing standards.

### Can you help with London-specific IoT deployments like tube stations or TfL integration?

Yes. We have experience with London Underground's challenging RF environment requiring careful antenna design and protocol selection for signal penetration. TfL integration requires adherence to their technical standards, security requirements, and operational procedures - we can navigate these requirements and coordinate with TfL's technical teams. Our team understands Network Rail specifications for railway IoT deployments. We've worked with London councils on smart city pilots requiring council approval processes and public space installation permits. Each deployment type has unique London-specific requirements we're familiar with.

### What's the typical ROI timeline for London IoT deployments?

London IoT deployments typically achieve ROI in 18-36 months depending on application. Energy management IoT (smart buildings, HVAC optimization) often delivers fastest ROI at 12-18 months through reduced energy costs (significant given London's high energy prices of £0.30-0.50/kWh). Asset tracking and utilization optimization typically delivers ROI in 18-24 months through improved efficiency and reduced equipment needs. Predictive maintenance IoT achieves ROI in 24-36 months through reduced downtime and maintenance costs. Customer analytics IoT (retail, hospitality) can deliver immediate value through increased conversions and customer spend. London's high operational costs accelerate IoT ROI compared to other UK regions.

### How do you handle data sovereignty for London businesses?

All data processing occurs within UK borders using AWS eu-west-2 (London), Azure UK South/UK West, or Google Cloud europe-west2 (London) regions. Data never leaves the UK unless explicitly required for your business operations. We implement UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 compliance including privacy by design, data minimization, and security measures. Cloud contracts include data processing agreements (DPAs) specifying UK data residency. For highly sensitive applications (financial services, healthcare, government), we can deploy on-premises or private cloud solutions maintaining complete data control. International data transfers (if needed) use Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.

### What ongoing support do you provide after London IoT deployment?

We offer tiered support packages: Business Hours (9am-6pm Mon-Fri, £1,000-3,000/month), Extended Hours (7am-10pm Mon-Sat, £2,500-6,000/month), and 24/7 Critical Support (£5,000-15,000/month). Support includes device management (firmware updates, configuration changes), connectivity management (SIM monitoring, data usage optimization), platform monitoring (uptime, performance, security alerts), and incident response (coordinated with your London operations team). We maintain 4-hour emergency response capability for London-based deployments allowing on-site support same day. Quarterly business reviews analyze performance metrics, identify optimization opportunities, and plan enhancements.

### Can IoT work in London's historic buildings?

Yes, though it requires careful planning. Historic buildings often have thick walls (stone, brick) limiting wireless signal penetration - we design using gateway strategies placing devices near windows or using wired connectivity where possible. Listed buildings prohibit certain modifications - we use non-invasive installation methods (adhesive mounting, existing cable routes) respecting heritage constraints. Power availability can be limited - we prioritize battery-powered sensors with 5-10 year life spans minimizing maintenance access. Westminster, Camden, and other historic London boroughs have strict planning requirements - we coordinate applications and provide technical documentation. We've successfully deployed IoT in Georgian terraces, Victorian warehouses, and Grade I/II listed buildings across London.
