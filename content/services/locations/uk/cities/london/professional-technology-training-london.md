### Can we use our Apprenticeship Levy to fund training?
Yes, absolutely. We're a registered training provider offering levy-funded apprenticeships at Levels 4-7 including Software Development, Cyber Security, Data Analytics, and DevOps Engineer programs. Large London employers (£3M+ payroll) paying the 0.5% apprenticeship levy can reclaim up to 95% of training costs. Unused levy expires after 24 months, so we help you maximize this valuable funding source. We handle all apprenticeship documentation, assessment, and end-point evaluation, ensuring compliance with Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) requirements.

### Are your cybersecurity courses NCSC-certified?
Yes, our core cybersecurity training programs are certified by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the London government's authority on cyber security. Specifically, our Cyber Essentials Awareness and Cyber Essentials Plus courses are NCSC-certified and prepare organizations for official CE/CE+ certification. We also deliver training aligned with NCSC's 10 Steps to Cyber Security framework. Our instructors hold government security clearances and have experience delivering to London public sector organizations.

### Do you offer training in cloud platforms using London regions?
Absolutely. All our AWS training uses the AWS London (eu-west-2) region, Azure training uses London South and London West regions, and Google Cloud training focuses on London zones. This is crucial because UK-based businesses need to understand data sovereignty, latency optimization, and UK-specific service availability. We cover GDPR compliance, London data protection requirements, and how to architect solutions that meet London regulatory standards. Our trainers understand the nuances of London cloud deployment including cost differences and regional limitations.

### What government funding options are available for small businesses?

Virtual delivery includes live instruction via Zoom/Teams, cloud-based lab environments, collaborative breakout exercises, recorded sessions for review, and real-time Q&A.
