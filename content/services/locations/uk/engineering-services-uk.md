## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do your engineers have Chartered Engineer (CEng) status?
Yes, our senior engineers hold Chartered Engineer (CEng) status with relevant UK engineering institutions including ICE (civil engineering), IStructE (structural engineering), IMechE (mechanical engineering), and IET (electrical engineering). CEng is the gold standard of UK engineering qualification demonstrating professional competence, ethics, and commitment to CPD. Our Chartered Engineers sign off structural calculations, design certifications, and professional opinions meeting UK Building Control, mortgage lender, and warranty provider requirements. All designs carry £10 million Professional Indemnity Insurance as standard.

### Can you design to UK Building Regulations for all regions?
Yes, we design to England & Wales Building Regulations (Approved Documents A-P), Scottish Building Standards (Technical Handbooks), and Northern Ireland Building Regulations (Technical Booklets). While fundamentally similar, these frameworks have regional differences requiring local expertise. Our engineers are experienced across all UK jurisdictions and maintain relationships with Local Authority Building Control and Approved Inspectors nationwide. We handle Building Control applications, respond to queries, coordinate inspections, and obtain Completion Certificates for projects across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

### What's included in your structural engineering service?
Our UK structural engineering service includes: site visit and existing structure assessment, structural calculations to Eurocodes and British Standards, structural drawings (GA, foundation, framing, details), specification of British structural materials (steel to BS standards, concrete mixes, masonry), Building Regulations Part A compliance documentation, Building Control liaison and query responses, structural engineer certificates for warranty providers, and construction phase support including site inspections. For residential projects, typical turnaround is 2-3 weeks. Commercial projects require 6-12 weeks depending on complexity.

### Do you provide CDM Principal Designer services?
Yes, we provide Principal Designer services under CDM Regulations 2015 for UK construction projects. The Principal Designer role is mandatory for projects with more than one contractor and includes: identifying and managing design stage health & safety risks, coordinating with other designers, preparing pre-construction information, producing Health & Safety Files, and liaising with Principal Contractors. Our CDM-qualified engineers understand British construction hazards, temporary works risks, and UK health & safety law. Principal Designer fees typically range from £2,000-£20,000 depending on project complexity and duration. This protects UK clients from HSE enforcement action.

### Can you engineer listed building alterations and heritage projects?
Yes, we specialize in sensitive structural interventions for UK listed buildings and conservation areas. Our heritage engineering includes: structural assessment of historic construction (timber frames, masonry, Victorian/Georgian/Edwardian structures), minimally invasive strengthening solutions, hidden structural supports respecting historic fabric, liaison with conservation officers and Historic England/Historic Environment Scotland, and compliance with listed building consent conditions. We understand traditional British building materials, period construction techniques, and conservation philosophy balancing structural needs with heritage protection. Listed building projects require particular care and typically cost 20-30% more than standard engineering due to additional analysis and sensitive solutions.

### What UK sustainability standards can you design to?
We design to all major UK sustainability standards including BREEAM (Excellent and Outstanding), Passivhaus/Passive House for ultra-low energy buildings, Home Quality Mark for sustainable housing, SKA Rating for office fit-outs, and WELL Building Standard for occupant wellbeing. Our sustainable engineering includes optimized structures (minimizing embodied carbon), high-performance building envelopes meeting demanding U-values, heat pump integration and low-carbon heating, renewable energy systems (solar PV, wind), and circular economy principles (design for disassembly, recycled materials). UK sustainability fees typically add 5-15% to base engineering costs but deliver long-term operational savings and enhanced building value.

### How quickly can you provide UK structural calculations for Building Control?
Turnaround depends on project complexity. Simple residential projects (loft conversion, single-story extension) typically take 5-10 working days from receiving information to delivering calculations and drawings. Medium complexity projects (two-story extensions, new houses) require 2-3 weeks. Commercial projects need 4-12 weeks depending on size and complexity. Rush services available for urgent UK projects (48-hour turnaround for simple residential at premium rates). We work efficiently with British Building Control Officers who often have tight timelines, and maintain good relationships with UK Building Control departments ensuring smooth approval processes. Our calculations are thorough, clearly presented, and include all information UK Building Control requires.
