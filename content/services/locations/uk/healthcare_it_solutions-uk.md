## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is SNOMED CT and why is it mandatory for UK healthcare IT?

SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms) is a comprehensive clinical terminology mandated by NHS Digital for recording clinical information. It's the world's most comprehensive healthcare terminology with 350,000+ concepts covering diagnoses, symptoms, procedures, body structures, organisms, medications, and clinical findings. NHS requires SNOMED CT because it enables: **Semantic Interoperability** (systems can understand clinical meaning, not just exchange data), **Hierarchical Analysis** (query all diabetes types using parent concept), **Consistent Recording** (same condition coded identically across NHS), **Longitudinal Records** (patient record maintained consistently over time), and **Clinical Decision Support** (alerts based on coded conditions). Implementation involves: SNOMED CT browser for term search, concept hierarchies for navigation, mapping to other code sets (ICD-10, READ codes), and integration with EPR/clinical systems. We provide complete SNOMED CT implementation ensuring NHS compliance.

### How do healthcare IT systems integrate with NHS Spine?

NHS Spine is national infrastructure providing core services for NHS systems. Integration requires: **Registration** with NHS Digital, obtaining organization and system identifiers. **Smartcards/RBAC** for user authentication and role-based access control. **Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP)** or direct Spine connection via N3/HSCN network. **API Integration** for specific services: PDS (patient demographics via SMSP or FHIR), SCR (summary care records via TMS client or FHIR), SDS (service lookup), and NHS Number allocation. **Message Exchange** via MESH for asynchronous document transfer. **Compliance & Assurance** including security assessments, Spine conformance certification, and DSPT completion. We handle complete Spine integration including NHS Digital liaison, compliance documentation, testing, and deployment to production Spine environment. Average timeline: 12-20 weeks depending on services required.

### What is Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) and how do we achieve it?

DSPT is annual self-assessment mandatory for all organizations accessing NHS patient data (including private providers integrating with NHS systems). It covers 10 data security standards: staff training, cyber security, data transfer security, unsupported systems, IT protection, securing mobile devices, passwords, secure configuration, incident response, and software updates. Achievement requires: **Evidence Gathering** (policies, training records, technical controls), **Technical Implementation** (encryption, firewalls, patch management, MFA), **Staff Training** (annual data security awareness for all staff), **Incident Management** (reporting procedure, lessons learned), and **Annual Submission** (self-assessment plus independent validation for trusts). We provide: gap analysis identifying current state, remediation plan addressing gaps, technical security controls implementation, policy and procedure documentation, staff training programs, and submission support. Timeline: 8-16 weeks for first-time compliance, ongoing annual updates. Failure to meet DSPT standards can result in NHS contract termination.

### Can healthcare apps access NHS patient data and how?

Yes, but with strict controls. Access mechanisms: **NHS App Integration** - Third-party apps can integrate with NHS App via APIs (requires NHS Digital approval, security assessment, and clinical safety assessment). **GP Connect** - Authorized systems can access GP records (requires formal data sharing agreements, IG Toolkit/DSPT, security standards). **Patient-Mediated Access** - Apps where patients explicitly share their own NHS data (GDPR lawful basis: consent, lower barriers but patient-controlled). **Direct NHS Contracts** - Apps commissioned by NHS (e.g., digital therapeutics, remote monitoring) get appropriate data access. Requirements include: **Information Governance** completing DSPT, data protection impact assessment, data sharing agreements. **Security** encryption, authentication, penetration testing, ISO 27001 recommended. **Clinical Safety** DCB0129/0160 compliance for clinical decision support. **Regulatory** MHRA registration if medical device, NICE evidence standards if making health claims. We navigate NHS digital approval processes, implement required controls, and achieve necessary certifications for NHS data access.

### What are HL7 FHIR UK core profiles and why use them?

HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is modern healthcare interoperability standard replacing older HL7 v2 messaging. FHIR uses RESTful APIs, JSON/XML, and resource-based architecture (Patient, Observation, Medication, etc.). UK core profiles are NHS Digital's standardization specifying how FHIR should be implemented across NHS: **UK Core Patient** (NHS Number, UK address format), **UK Core Practitioner** (GMC numbers, professional roles), **UK Core Organization** (ODS codes), **UK Core Medication** (dm+d integration), and specialty-specific profiles. Benefits: **Modern Architecture** (RESTful, mobile-friendly), **Standardization** (consistent implementation across NHS), **Ecosystem** (growing FHIR tool ecosystem), **Flexibility** (easier than traditional HL7 v2), and **NHS Alignment** (required for new NHS integrations). GP Connect, NHS App, e-RS all use FHIR. We build FHIR servers, implement UK core profiles, and integrate with NHS FHIR services, future-proofing healthcare IT for UK organizations.

### How do you ensure clinical safety in healthcare IT development?

Clinical safety is paramount for healthcare IT to avoid patient harm from software errors. We follow NHS Digital Clinical Safety standards: **DCB0129** (organizational clinical risk management) establishes governance, processes, and competencies. **DCB0160** (system-level clinical risk management) applies systematic hazard analysis throughout lifecycle. Our approach: **Clinical Safety Officer** - CCIO or clinical safety officer reviews all clinical aspects. **Hazard Analysis** - Systematic identification of potential harms (wrong data displayed, delayed alerts, medication errors). **Risk Assessment** - Likelihood and severity scoring, prioritized mitigation. **Safety Requirements** - Functional requirements derived from hazards (e.g., timeout warnings for sterile workflows). **Testing** - Clinical safety testing scenarios, UAT with clinicians. **Clinical Safety Case** - Formal documentation for NHS Digital/CQC. **Ongoing Surveillance** - Post-deployment incident monitoring, regular safety reviews. We employ clinical informaticians and maintain clinical advisory boards ensuring software serves patient safety, not just functional requirements. All healthcare IT should follow these standards even if not contractually required.

### What does healthcare IT project timeline look like for NHS implementation?

NHS healthcare IT timelines are longer than commercial software due to clinical complexity, safety requirements, and NHS governance. Typical phases: **Discovery & Requirements** (8-12 weeks) - Clinical workflow analysis, requirements gathering with clinicians, initial safety assessment, NHS integration scoping. **Design & Prototyping** (6-10 weeks) - UI/UX design with clinical validation, data model including SNOMED CT, architecture design for NHS integration. **Development Sprints** (16-40 weeks) - Agile development with clinical review every sprint, FHIR/HL7 integration development, SNOMED CT implementation. **Clinical Safety Assessment** (4-8 weeks) - Formal hazard analysis, clinical safety case documentation, independent clinical safety review. **Testing** (8-12 weeks) - Functional testing, integration testing with NHS systems, clinical user acceptance testing, security testing. **NHS Assurance** (8-16 weeks) - Spine conformance if applicable, NHS Digital assurance processes, DSPT completion, go-live approval. **Deployment & Training** (4-8 weeks) - Phased rollout, clinical staff training, go-live support. **Hypercare** (4-12 weeks) - Intensive post-go-live support, issue resolution, optimization. Total: 12-24 months for major systems. Quick wins (patient apps, simple integrations) possible in 3-6 months.
