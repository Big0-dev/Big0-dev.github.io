# Cybersecurity Services in the United Kingdom

Big0 delivers comprehensive cybersecurity services across the UK, protecting businesses from evolving cyber threats while ensuring compliance with NCSC guidance, Cyber Essentials requirements, and industry-specific security regulations. With security operations centers in London and Manchester, we serve organizations throughout England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Our UK cybersecurity practice combines world-class technical expertise with deep understanding of the British threat landscape, regulatory requirements (NIS Regulations, GDPR, sector-specific rules), and government security frameworks including NCSC guidance and CHECK scheme standards.

## Why UK Organizations Choose Big0 for Cybersecurity

The UK faces sophisticated cyber threats from nation-state actors, organized crime groups, and opportunistic attackers. British businesses, government agencies, and critical infrastructure providers require robust security measures that address these threats while meeting stringent regulatory requirements.

**NCSC Guidance & Government Standards**
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) provides authoritative cybersecurity guidance for UK organizations. We align all security implementations with NCSC recommendations, including the Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) for critical infrastructure, 10 Steps to Cyber Security, and Cloud Security Principles for cloud adoption.

**Cyber Essentials & Cyber Essentials Plus**
As a Cyber Essentials certified organization, we help UK businesses achieve and maintain Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus certification. These government-backed schemes are mandatory for public sector contracts over £5 million and increasingly expected by private sector supply chains.

**CHECK Scheme Penetration Testing**
Our security team includes CHECK-accredited penetration testers certified by the NCSC. CHECK (CREST-accredited) scheme ensures penetration testing meets government standards, required for public sector organizations and recommended for critical infrastructure.

**Financial Services Security (CBEST, DORA)**
For financial services organizations, we provide CBEST (threat-led penetration testing), compliance with FCA requirements, implementation of DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) controls, and alignment with Bank of England supervisory expectations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus?

Cyber Essentials is a self-assessment against five technical security controls (firewalls, secure configuration, user access control, malware protection, patch management), certified by an external certification body reviewing your answers. Cyber Essentials Plus includes everything in Cyber Essentials plus hands-on technical verification where a certification body assessor actually tests your systems to confirm controls are properly implemented. Cyber Essentials costs £2,000-£4,000 and takes 2-4 weeks; Cyber Essentials Plus costs £4,000-£8,000 and takes 4-6 weeks. Many UK government contracts and security-conscious private sector organizations now require Cyber Essentials Plus.

### Do I need CHECK scheme penetration testing?

CHECK scheme penetration testing is mandatory for UK central government departments, wider public sector bodies, and many critical national infrastructure operators. It's conducted by NCSC-certified (CREST-accredited) penetration testers following government-approved methodologies. Even if not mandatory for your organization, CHECK testing provides assurance that security testing meets the highest UK standards. Financial services organizations often use CBEST (threat-led testing) instead. We help you determine which testing regime applies to your organization and regulatory requirements.

### How long does ISO 27001 certification take in the UK?

ISO 27001 implementation typically takes 6-12 months for most UK organizations, depending on current security maturity and organizational complexity. The process includes: gap analysis (4-6 weeks), ISMS design and implementation (3-6 months), internal audit (2-4 weeks), management review, certification audit stage 1 (documentation review, 1-2 weeks), remediation (2-4 weeks), and certification audit stage 2 (on-site assessment, 1-2 weeks). Fast-track approaches can achieve certification in 4-6 months for smaller organizations with good existing security. We provide complete implementation support ensuring first-time certification success.

### What are NIS Regulations and do they apply to my business?

Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations apply to operators of essential services (OES) in seven sectors: energy, transport, health, water, digital infrastructure, and banking/financial market infrastructure, plus digital service providers (online marketplaces, search engines, cloud services) operating in the UK. If you're an OES, you must implement appropriate security measures, notify authorities of significant incidents within 72 hours, and demonstrate compliance to sector regulators. We help determine if NIS applies to you and implement required security and incident notification controls. UK has proposed NIS2 Regulations expanding scope significantly.

### How do you help with GDPR security requirements?

GDPR requires "appropriate technical and organizational measures" to protect personal data. We implement technical security controls including: encryption of personal data at rest and in transit, pseudonymization where appropriate, access controls limiting who can access data, security monitoring detecting data breaches, incident response capabilities ensuring breach notification within 72 hours to ICO, regular security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scans), secure backup and recovery, and privacy by design in new systems. We also support Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing, ensuring security measures are proportionate to risks. Our implementations align with ICO guidance and GDPR Article 32 requirements.

### What is DORA and how does it affect UK financial services?

Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is EU regulation (effective January 2025) establishing comprehensive ICT risk management requirements for financial institutions. UK financial services must comply if operating in EU or implement equivalent standards for FCA/PRA compliance. DORA requires: robust ICT risk management framework, incident reporting (classification and notification), digital operational resilience testing (including threat-led penetration testing), third-party ICT risk management, and information sharing on threats and vulnerabilities. We help UK financial institutions implement DORA requirements and align with UK regulators' operational resilience expectations, creating unified compliance approach.

### How quickly can you respond to a security incident?

Our UK incident response team provides 24/7 emergency response with initial response within 1 hour for critical incidents and 4 hours for non-critical incidents. Response includes: immediate containment to prevent further damage, forensic analysis to understand attack scope and methods, evidence preservation for potential legal action, eradication of threats from your environment, recovery of affected systems, and regulatory notification support (ICO breach notification within 72 hours for GDPR). We maintain incident response retainers for priority response and can support ad-hoc incidents. UK-based team means we understand local regulatory requirements, work in your time zone, and can provide on-site support in London, Manchester, or nationwide within hours.
