## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you ensure IR35 compliance for UK contractors?
We take IR35 compliance extremely seriously. Our process includes: comprehensive CEST assessments for all engagements, contract review by employment law specialists, Statement of Work (SoW) structuring where appropriate to minimize inside IR35 risk, Status Determination Statements (SDS) for all contractors, and regular compliance audits. We offer multiple engagement options including umbrella companies, PSCs (Personal Service Companies), and SoW-based projects. Our compliance team stays current with HMRC guidance and case law to protect both clients and contractors.

### Can you provide security-cleared professionals for government projects?
Yes, we maintain a pool of SC (Security Check) and DV (Developed Vetting) cleared technology professionals. We also sponsor security clearance applications for suitable candidates, though this process takes 6-8 weeks for SC and 4-6 months for DV clearance. We conduct Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks as standard and can arrange Counter-Terrorist Checks (CTC) as needed. All cleared personnel understand government security protocols and have experience with OFFICIAL and SECRET classified systems.

### What's the typical timeframe to place an IT contractor in the UK?
For standard roles without security clearance requirements, we can provide suitable candidates within 1-2 weeks. This includes: initial requirements gathering (2-3 days), talent sourcing and vetting (3-5 days), candidate presentation and interviews (3-5 days), and contract finalization (2-3 days). For specialized roles or those requiring security clearance, timelines extend to 3-4 weeks (existing clearance) or 2-6 months (new clearance required). Rush placements can be accommodated within 48-72 hours from our bench of immediately available professionals.

### How do you handle post-Brexit visa sponsorship for international talent?
We hold a Skilled Worker sponsor license and manage the entire visa sponsorship process. Our services include: Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) application and issuance, salary threshold verification (£38,700 general threshold or £30,960 for shortage occupations), Immigration Skills Charge payment, visa application support, and Home Office compliance management. The process takes 3-4 weeks for standard applications or 5-10 days for priority processing. We also advise on the Global Talent visa route for exceptional technology professionals.

### What are your rates compared to UK recruitment agencies?
Our rates are competitive with premium UK tech recruitment agencies but offer significantly better value. For contract placements, we charge a transparent day rate with no hidden fees. Typical rates: mid-level developers £400-£550/day, senior engineers £600-£800/day, and specialists £700-£1,100/day (including our margin). This is 10-20% below traditional agency rates while providing superior quality through rigorous vetting. For permanent placements, we charge 15-20% of first-year salary (vs 20-25% industry standard), with a 3-month replacement guarantee.

### Can you provide entire project teams, not just individual contractors?
Absolutely. We regularly build complete project teams including developers, testers, DevOps engineers, project managers, and business analysts. Our team assembly process ensures complementary skills, proven collaboration experience, and shared technical approaches. Teams can be co-located, remote, or hybrid based on your preferences. We provide team leads with UK project management experience and establish clear communication protocols. Team sizes range from 3-5 members for small projects to 20+ for enterprise initiatives, with the ability to scale up or down as needed.

### What happens if a placed contractor doesn't work out?
We offer a comprehensive 30-day replacement guarantee. If a contractor proves unsuitable due to skill mismatch, performance issues, or cultural fit problems, we'll provide an alternative candidate at no additional cost. Our process includes: immediate issue assessment, identification of specific concerns, rapid sourcing of replacement candidates (typically within 48-72 hours), smooth transition management, and post-mortem analysis to prevent recurrence. Our rigorous vetting process means replacement rates are below 5%, but we stand behind every placement with this guarantee.
