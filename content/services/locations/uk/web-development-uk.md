## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you ensure UK websites meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements?

WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility is legal requirement for UK public sector (Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018) and best practice for all British websites. We ensure UK accessibility through design phase including color contrast meeting British requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text, checking all British brand colors), text alternatives for images (alt text describing British content for screen readers), keyboard navigation (all UK functionality accessible without mouse), and heading structure (logical hierarchy for British screen reader users). Development implementation uses semantic HTML for UK assistive technology compatibility, ARIA labels for complex British components, form labels and error messages for UK users, and focus indicators for British keyboard users. Testing includes automated accessibility testing (aXe, WAVE, Lighthouse for UK sites), manual testing with screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver on British content), keyboard-only testing (navigating UK site without mouse), and user testing with British users with disabilities. For UK public sector, we provide accessibility statements complying with regulations, WCAG conformance documentation, and ongoing monitoring maintaining British accessibility. Common UK accessibility issues we fix include poor color contrast (fails British low-vision users), missing alt text (images invisible to UK screen readers), inaccessible forms (British users can't submit), and keyboard traps (UK users stuck in navigation). We educate British clients on accessibility importance: legal requirement for UK public sector, business benefits (larger British audience, better SEO for UK), and ethical obligation to British users with disabilities (15-20% UK population). WCAG compliance makes British websites better for all UK users, not just those with disabilities - clear navigation, readable text, and logical structure benefit all British visitors.

### What UK payment gateways do you integrate and what are the costs?

UK payment gateway selection depends on British business requirements and customer preferences. Stripe UK is our most common UK recommendation: competitive rates (1.4% + 20p for British cards, 2.9% + 20p for international cards), excellent developer experience for UK integration, comprehensive features (subscriptions, invoicing for British businesses), and fast payouts to UK bank accounts (2 business days). Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) compliance for UK PSD2, Apple Pay and Google Pay for British mobile users, and fraud prevention protecting UK merchants. Stripe works for most UK businesses from startups to enterprises. PayPal UK provides British consumer trust: higher rates (2.9% + 30p for UK transactions) but British buyer familiarity, PayPal Credit for UK installment payments, and dispute resolution favoring British buyers. Good for UK consumer e-commerce where PayPal checkout preference is strong. WorldPay (now FIS) serves British enterprise: enterprise pricing (negotiated for large UK volume), traditional acquiring for British businesses, and strong UK retail presence. Higher setup complexity but good for established British retailers. SagePay/Opayo (Elavon) popular with UK SMEs: competitive British rates, trusted UK brand, and local British support. GoCardless specializes in UK Direct Debit: lowest cost for recurring British payments (1% capped at £2), direct bank transfer for UK subscriptions, and compliance with UK Direct Debit scheme. Ideal for British SaaS and subscriptions. We implement multiple UK payment options (Stripe + PayPal + bank transfer common) giving British customers choice. UK payment considerations include Strong Customer Authentication (3D Secure 2 required for British cards post-PSD2), dynamic currency conversion (letting British international customers pay in GBP), and fraud prevention (address verification, 3D Secure for UK transactions). For UK businesses taking payments, we recommend starting with Stripe UK for ease and features, adding PayPal for British consumer preference, and considering specialists (GoCardless for UK Direct Debit, Adyen for British international) as business scales. Payment gateway choice significantly impacts UK conversion (British customers abandon checkout without preferred payment) and costs (rates vary significantly on British transaction volumes).

### How do you optimize UK websites for Google.co.uk search rankings?

UK SEO requires optimizing for British search behavior and Google.co.uk algorithm. We start with UK keyword research including Google Keyword Planner for British search volumes, UK competitor analysis (what British competitors rank for), search intent understanding British user needs (informational, commercial, transactional UK queries), and long-tail keywords for British niche targeting. On-page UK optimization includes British English content (spelling, terminology, cultural references British users expect), title tags with UK keywords (60 character limit, British commercial keywords front-loaded), meta descriptions for British click-through (155 characters, compelling for UK users), and heading structure (H1, H2, H3 for British content hierarchy). Technical UK SEO includes site speed for British users (Core Web Vitals, mobile performance for UK), mobile-friendliness (responsive design for British mobile majority), HTTPS security for UK (ranking factor and British user trust), and structured data (Schema.org for British rich results). Content strategy creates British-focused content including blog posts targeting UK keywords, landing pages for British commercial queries, location pages for UK cities (London, Manchester, Edinburgh), and multimedia (images, videos for British engagement). UK local SEO includes Google Business Profile optimized for British location, NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone across UK citations), local citations from British directories (Yell, Thomson, Yelp UK), and reviews from satisfied British customers. Link building acquires British backlinks including guest posts on UK industry sites, digital PR for British media coverage, broken link building on UK websites, and partnerships with British organizations. We avoid spammy UK link building (paid links, link farms) violating Google guidelines. UK vs international SEO differences include British English (colour not color, lorry not truck), UK-specific search features (job search for British employment, COVID info for UK), .co.uk vs .com (UK users prefer British domains), and local pack for UK local search. We track UK SEO metrics including British keyword rankings in Google.co.uk, UK organic traffic from Google Analytics, British conversion rate from organic, and rankings in UK SERP features (featured snippets, People Also Ask, local pack). SEO is long-term for British visibility - typically 3-6 months to see UK ranking improvements, ongoing effort to maintain and grow British organic traffic.

### What's your experience with UK public sector websites and GDS standards?

We have significant UK public sector web development experience including central government digital services for British ministries, local council websites for UK local authorities, NHS websites for British healthcare, and education platforms for UK schools and universities. GDS Service Standard compliance requires meeting all 14 points: understanding British users and their needs (user research with UK citizens), solving whole problem (end-to-end British service), providing joined-up experience (across government departments serving UK), making service simple to use (minimizing British user burden), ensuring everyone can use service (WCAG 2.1 Level AA for all British users including disabled), having skilled team (multidisciplinary with British public sector experience), using agile ways of working (iterative delivery, British user feedback), iterating and improving frequently (continuous improvement based on UK data), creating secure service (protecting British user information per NCSC), defining success metrics (KPIs measuring British user outcomes), choosing right tools and technology (open standards, avoiding UK vendor lock-in), making new source code open (publishing British code publicly), using and contributing to common standards and patterns (GOV.UK Design System), and operating reliable service (uptime, performance, British user support). We implement GOV.UK Design System components ensuring British government consistency, start pages setting UK user expectations, step-by-step navigation for complex British journeys, and accessible forms with inline validation for UK users. UK public sector web requirements include accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA legally required), plain English (average UK reading age 9-11 for government content), security (OFFICIAL classification, Cyber Essentials for British government), and open standards (HTML, JSON, open APIs for UK). We prepare services for GDS assessment including evidence collection (user research, accessibility testing, British security measures), service assessment presentation, and addressing panel feedback from British assessors. UK public sector procurement uses G-Cloud framework (pre-approved suppliers for British government), Crown Commercial Service frameworks, and social value requirements (demonstrating benefits to UK communities). Common UK public sector challenges include legacy system integration (connecting to old British government systems), cross-department collaboration (multiple UK departments, complex governance), political sensitivity (high-profile British services, ministerial scrutiny), and budget constraints (demonstrating British taxpayer value). We bring UK public sector experience understanding government context, regulatory requirements, and user needs (British citizens interacting with government). Our approach combines GDS best practices with pragmatism recognizing British public sector realities.

### How do you handle GDPR and cookies for UK websites?

UK GDPR and cookie compliance is critical for British websites. GDPR requirements include lawful basis for processing British personal data (consent for marketing, legitimate interests for analytics, contract for user accounts), privacy policy explaining British data processing in plain English (what data, why, how long, British user rights), data minimization (collecting only necessary UK information), and data subject rights (British users can access, correct, delete their data). We implement privacy by design including minimal data collection from UK users, encryption for British form submissions, secure British user authentication, and retention policies deleting old UK data. UK cookie compliance follows ePrivacy Regulations (PECR) via ICO guidance requiring consent before non-essential cookies, no pre-ticked consent boxes for British users, granular consent for different UK cookie types (analytics, marketing, functional), and easy British consent withdrawal. We implement cookie banners meeting UK standards including clear UK cookie explanation (not legal jargon), genuine choice for British users (accept all, reject all, customize), cookie policy detailing UK cookies used, and consent management platform (CMP) recording British user choices. Cookie categories include necessary cookies (no consent required - British shopping cart, authentication), functional cookies (site preferences for UK users), analytics cookies (understanding British user behavior - Google Analytics requires consent), and marketing cookies (targeting UK users - requires explicit consent). We use consent management platforms (OneTrust, Cookiebot, custom for British sites) providing compliant UK cookie banners, consent storage (remembering British user choices), cookie scanning (inventorying all UK cookies), and consent mode for analytics (Google Analytics 4 consent mode for British users). GDPR violations risk ICO fines up to £17.5M or 4% revenue for British organizations - compliance is essential. We help UK businesses implement proportionate GDPR measures: heavyweight processes for British high-risk processing (health data, children, profiling), lighter-touch for UK low-risk websites (basic contact forms, British business info). British website GDPR essentials: privacy policy (explaining UK data processing), cookie consent (before non-essential cookies), contact forms (secure, minimal data from British users), and data subject request process (British users can access/delete their data). We stay current with UK data protection evolution: ICO guidance updates, PECR reviews, and British case law interpreting GDPR.

### What ongoing maintenance and support do UK websites need?

UK website maintenance is critical for security, performance, and British user experience. Security updates include CMS updates (WordPress, Drupal core updates for British sites), plugin updates (fixing UK security vulnerabilities), SSL certificate renewal (HTTPS for British encryption), and security monitoring (detecting UK attacks, malware on British sites). Without UK updates, websites become vulnerable - WordPress sites especially targeted attacking British businesses through outdated plugins. Content updates include blog posts for British SEO and thought leadership, page updates (services, team, UK business changes), image updates (new British products, team photos), and seasonal content (UK holidays, British events). We provide British content management training or handle UK updates as service. Performance monitoring includes uptime monitoring (alerting when British site down), speed monitoring (tracking UK load times), broken link checks (fixing British 404s), and analytics review (understanding UK user behavior). Backup management provides recovery from British disasters including automated daily backups (full British site and database), offsite storage (separate from UK production hosting), backup testing (verifying British recovery works), and retention policy (keeping UK historical backups). SEO maintenance includes keyword monitoring (tracking British rankings), content optimization (improving UK underperforming pages), technical SEO (fixing British crawl errors), and link building (ongoing British backlinks). Browser compatibility testing ensures British site works including Chrome/Safari/Firefox/Edge testing (browsers UK users use), mobile testing (British phone and tablet), and fixing UK compatibility issues. Support services include technical support (fixing British site issues), hosting support (server problems affecting UK site), training (helping British team use website), and strategy (advising on UK website improvements). UK maintenance costs vary: basic maintenance £500-1,000/month for British SME sites (updates, backups, monitoring), comprehensive £2,000-5,000/month for British e-commerce/enterprise (including content, SEO, support), custom for complex UK platforms. Many British businesses neglect website maintenance until disaster (hack, crash, British data loss) - proactive maintenance prevents UK website emergencies, keeps British site secure and fast, and improves UK search rankings through fresh content. We recommend all UK websites have maintenance plan: at minimum security updates and backups, ideally comprehensive British website management ensuring optimal performance, security, and UK user experience.

### Should UK businesses use .co.uk or .com domain and does it matter for SEO?

UK domain choice impacts British SEO and user trust. .co.uk domains signal British business to UK users, preferred by British audiences (local trust, British identity), benefit UK local SEO (Google understands British targeting), and required for some British business types (UK companies often choose .co.uk). .com domains are international generic TLD, familiar globally, perceived as larger/international, and better for UK businesses targeting multiple markets. For British businesses primarily serving UK market, we recommend .co.uk as primary domain: better British SEO (especially UK local search), British user trust (local business, UK-based), and availability (many .com taken, .co.uk available for British names). For UK businesses targeting internationally, options include .com as primary (global audience, international perception), .co.uk redirecting to .com (preserving British domain), or multi-domain strategy (.co.uk for UK, .com for international). Google treats .co.uk as geotargeted to UK (helps British rankings, may hurt non-UK) while .com is neutral (requires Google Search Console geotargeting or UK hosting signals). SEO best practices include choosing primary UK domain (.co.uk or .com), redirecting others to primary (avoid duplicate British content), setting Google Search Console country targeting (specify UK for .com), and using hreflang for international (UK vs US vs other markets). British domain extensions include .co.uk (commercial UK), .org.uk (British organizations/charities), .uk (newer UK TLD, less popular), and .london/.scot/.wales (UK city/region TLDs). Trust signals include .co.uk for British businesses (local, established UK domain), .com for international (globally recognized), and caution with unfamiliar TLDs (UK users may distrust). For most UK businesses, we recommend securing both .co.uk and .com: use .co.uk as primary for British market, redirect .com to .co.uk, and secure .com preventing UK competitors using it. International UK businesses might reverse: .com primary, .co.uk redirecting. Domain is first impression for British users and foundation for UK SEO - choose thoughtfully for British business goals.
