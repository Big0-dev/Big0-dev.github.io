## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between VR, AR, and MR?

Virtual Reality (VR) provides fully immersive digital experiences replacing physical world with virtual environment using headsets blocking outside view (Quest, PSVR, Vive). Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital content on physical world through smartphone cameras or AR glasses maintaining physical environment visibility (mobile AR, HoloLens). Mixed Reality (MR) blends physical and virtual more deeply with virtual objects anchored to and interacting with physical environment (HoloLens 2, Vision Pro mixed reality mode). Choose VR for immersive training/entertainment requiring full attention, AR for hands-free information overlay and mobile experiences, and MR for applications blending physical and virtual objects.

### Which VR platform should we target?

Platform selection depends on audience, budget, and application type. Target Meta Quest for consumer VR (largest market, accessible price, standalone wireless), PCVR (Vive, Index, Rift) for highest-fidelity enterprise training requiring maximum realism, Vision Pro for premium enterprise applications and early adopters, HoloLens 2 for enterprise AR in industrial environments, and mobile AR (iOS/Android) for maximum reach without dedicated hardware. Most commercial projects target Quest for market size while high-end enterprise training may justify PCVR. Cross-platform development using Unity maximizes reach but may limit platform-specific features.

### How much does VR/AR development cost?

Costs vary enormously based on scope, quality, and platform. Simple mobile AR experiences cost $25k-$80k. Basic VR training modules cost $40k-$100k. Complex VR training programs cost $100k-$400k. Enterprise VR/AR platforms cost $400k-$1.5M+. Location-based VR experiences cost $200k-$800k. These ranges assume professional development teams; solo developers reduce costs through sweat equity while corporate development with overhead increases costs. Factor ongoing costs for content updates, platform maintenance, and analytics. Request detailed estimates based on specific requirements.

### Does VR training really work better than traditional training?

Extensive research demonstrates VR training effectiveness. PwC study found VR training improves knowledge retention 4x compared to classroom training and 1.5x compared to e-learning. Boeing reports VR trainees achieve proficiency 35% faster with 90% accuracy improvement. Walmart's VR training improved employee confidence 30% and knowledge retention 70%. VR's effectiveness stems from learning-by-doing (experiential learning), emotional engagement creating stronger memory formation, risk-free practice enabling mistakes without consequences, and consistent repeatable experiences ensuring training quality. VR works best for procedural training, equipment operation, safety scenarios, and soft skills requiring realistic social interaction.

### Can we update VR/AR content ourselves after development?

This depends on how applications are architected. Content Management System (CMS) approaches enable non-technical updates to scenarios, 3D models, text, media, and configuration parameters through web interfaces similar to website CMS. This requires additional development investment (15-30% of base project) but enables ongoing content evolution without developer dependency. Without CMS, updates require developer involvement incurring ongoing costs but providing maximum flexibility. We recommend CMS approaches for training applications requiring frequent updates (new procedures, updated safety protocols) while bespoke applications without frequent changes may not justify CMS investment.

### What hardware do users need for VR experiences?

Hardware requirements depend on target platform. Meta Quest requires only the headset ($299-$499) with no external hardware or PC needed - users download apps from Quest Store. PCVR requires gaming PC ($1,200+ with VR-capable GPU) plus VR headset ($400-$1,000). Vision Pro costs $3,499 as standalone device. Mobile AR requires modern iPhone (iPhone 12+) or ARCore-compatible Android phone. For enterprise deployments, we help specify hardware, estimate total costs, and recommend deployment models (company-provided vs. BYOD). Most enterprise clients purchase hardware as capital investment while consumer apps assume users own devices.

### How long does VR/AR development take?

Development timelines correlate with scope and complexity. Simple mobile AR experiences require 1-3 months. Basic VR training modules need 2-4 months. Complex VR training programs require 4-8 months. Enterprise VR/AR platforms need 8-18 months. Location-based VR experiences take 6-12 months. These estimates assume clear requirements, responsive clients, and experienced teams. Add 20-30% buffer for first projects, new platforms, or innovative interactions requiring R&D. Iterative approaches deliver initial versions quickly (8-12 weeks) then enhance based on user feedback managing risk while providing early value.
