## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you ensure ADA compliance in your designs?
We build accessibility into every stage of our design process, not as an afterthought. Our designs comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and ADA Section 508 requirements from the initial wireframes through final delivery. This includes proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader optimization, and comprehensive accessibility testing with users who rely on assistive technologies. We provide detailed accessibility documentation and can coordinate with your legal team to ensure full compliance, protecting your business from the rising tide of ADA lawsuits affecting US companies.

### What's the typical timeline for a product design project in the USA?
Timeline varies based on project complexity and scope. A typical MVP product design project takes 8-12 weeks, including discovery, user research, design iterations, and usability testing. Enterprise-scale projects or complex SaaS platforms may require 16-24 weeks for comprehensive design systems and multi-platform experiences. We can accelerate timelines for venture-funded startups with funding deadlines or market launch targets, offering expedited 6-8 week sprints for critical go-to-market needs.

### Do you conduct user research with American users?
Absolutely. We conduct extensive user research with diverse American audiences across demographics, regions, and use cases. Our research methods include one-on-one interviews, focus groups, surveys, usability testing, and A/B testing with real US users. We recruit participants from your target markets—whether that's New York financial professionals, San Francisco tech workers, or Austin consumers—ensuring insights reflect authentic American user needs and behaviors. All research complies with US privacy laws including CCPA and state-specific requirements.

### Can you design for highly regulated US industries?
Yes, we specialize in designing for regulated industries including healthcare (HIPAA), financial services (SOX, SEC), and government contractors (Section 508). Our team understands the compliance requirements, security considerations, and user expectations unique to these sectors. We've designed HIPAA-compliant patient portals, SOC 2 certified enterprise platforms, and Section 508 compliant government systems. We work closely with your compliance team to ensure designs meet all regulatory requirements while delivering exceptional user experience.

### How do your design services support venture funding?
Our designs are optimized to help secure VC funding in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, NYC, and Austin. We create compelling product demos, investor-ready prototypes, and pitch deck visuals that showcase your product's potential to American investors. Many of our startup clients have successfully raised Series A and B funding using our designs to demonstrate product vision and market opportunity. We understand what Sand Hill Road investors look for and craft designs that tell your product story effectively.

### What design tools and handoff formats do you provide?
We work with industry-standard tools including Figma (primary), Adobe XD, and Sketch, ensuring compatibility with your development team's workflow. Our design handoff packages include organized Figma files with detailed specifications, interactive prototypes for stakeholder review, comprehensive design systems with reusable components, style guides and documentation, and developer-friendly assets exported in all required formats. We provide design tokens for easy integration with popular US development frameworks and maintain clear communication channels during implementation.

### How do you handle design for different US regions and demographics?
We understand that the US market isn't monolithic—user preferences and behaviors vary significantly across regions, age groups, and cultural backgrounds. Our design process includes research with diverse American audiences to ensure your product resonates across different segments. We consider regional differences (East Coast vs. West Coast preferences), demographic variations (Gen Z vs. Baby Boomers), accessibility needs (61 million Americans with disabilities), and cultural sensitivities. This comprehensive approach ensures your product succeeds across the entire US market, not just in coastal tech hubs.
