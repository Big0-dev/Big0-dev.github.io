## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you ensure ADA compliance for websites?
ADA compliance is built into our development process from the beginning, not added as an afterthought. We follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines throughout design and development, implementing proper semantic HTML structure, ARIA labels for interactive elements, keyboard navigation support, sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum), alternative text for all images, and captions for video content. Every website undergoes comprehensive accessibility testing including automated scanning with enterprise tools, manual testing by accessibility specialists, and screen reader testing with JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. We provide detailed accessibility documentation and can coordinate with your legal team. With ADA lawsuits affecting thousands of US businesses annually, our proactive approach protects your company while expanding your market to 61 million Americans with disabilities.

### What's the typical timeline for website development in the USA?
Timeline varies based on website complexity and scope. A small business website (10-15 pages) typically takes 8-12 weeks from kickoff to launch, including discovery, design, development, content integration, and testing. Corporate websites with custom functionality require 12-16 weeks. E-commerce platforms need 16-24 weeks depending on product catalog size and integrations. Complex web applications may require 24-40 weeks for full implementation. Enterprise websites with multiple stakeholders often take 20-30 weeks including extended approval cycles. We can accelerate timelines for urgent launches through dedicated team allocation, though we never compromise on quality, accessibility, or SEO fundamentals essential for long-term success in competitive US markets.

### How do you optimize websites for US search engines?
Our SEO optimization is comprehensive, targeting both technical and content factors Google uses to rank US websites. Technical optimization includes Core Web Vitals performance meeting Google's thresholds, mobile-first responsive design, structured data with Schema.org markup, optimized XML sitemaps, proper canonical tags, SSL security, and fast load times across US regions through CDN distribution. On-page optimization includes keyword research targeting terms Americans actually search, optimized title tags and meta descriptions, proper header hierarchy, internal linking architecture, and SEO-friendly content structure. We also implement local SEO for businesses serving specific US markets, Google Business Profile optimization, and ongoing monitoring of search performance. Our websites consistently achieve first-page rankings for competitive US search terms within 3-6 months.

### Can you integrate with our existing business systems?
Absolutely. Integration with existing US business systems is a core capability. We routinely integrate websites with popular American platforms including Salesforce CRM, HubSpot marketing automation, Marketo, Mailchimp and email platforms, QuickBooks and accounting systems, NetSuite ERP, inventory management systems, shipping carriers (UPS, FedEx, USPS), payment processors (Stripe, Square, PayPal), and hundreds of other tools used by US businesses. Our integration approach includes RESTful APIs for modern platforms, webhook implementations for real-time updates, database connections where appropriate, middleware development for complex integrations, and comprehensive error handling ensuring reliability. We've completed thousands of integrations and can navigate both technical and organizational challenges typical in US enterprise environments.

### What payment options should my US website accept?
Payment options significantly impact conversion rates in the US market. We recommend accepting credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) as baseline, Apple Pay and Google Pay (used by 55% of US smartphone users), PayPal (trusted by 200+ million Americans), and increasingly, buy now pay later options like Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay popular with younger Americans. For B2B sites, consider ACH/eCheck for larger transactions. For subscription services, implement automated recurring billing. We typically integrate Stripe as primary processor due to its comprehensive features, competitive rates, and excellent developer experience, while also supporting alternative processors based on your specific industry needs and existing merchant relationships. All integrations include PCI compliance, fraud detection, and secure payment handling protecting your business and customers.

### How do you ensure website performance across the USA?
Performance across diverse US geography requires strategic technical implementation. We use Content Delivery Networks (CDN) with edge locations across major US cities ensuring content serves from nearest location whether users are in New York, San Francisco, or Austin. Image optimization includes WebP/AVIF formats, responsive sizing, and lazy loading reducing initial page weight. Code optimization includes minification, compression, and elimination of render-blocking resources. We implement aggressive caching strategies at multiple levels, optimize databases for query performance, and use asynchronous loading for non-critical resources. Sites are tested on actual US networks including 4G/5G mobile connections from major carriers. We consistently achieve Google PageSpeed scores of 90+ and Core Web Vitals metrics meeting all Google thresholds, ensuring fast experiences for American users regardless of location or device.

### What ongoing maintenance and support do you provide?
Comprehensive ongoing support keeps your website secure, fast, and effective. Our maintenance services include security updates and patching (critical for WordPress and other platforms targeted by hackers), performance monitoring and optimization, uptime monitoring with 24/7 alerting, backup and disaster recovery, content updates and page modifications, technical support for your team, ADA compliance monitoring, SEO performance tracking, and analytics reporting with actionable insights. We offer flexible maintenance packages from basic ($1,000-$2,000/month) covering security and updates, to comprehensive ($3,000-$5,000/month) including ongoing optimization, content updates, and dedicated support.
