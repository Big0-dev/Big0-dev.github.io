## Frequently Asked Questions

### What testing is required for SOC 2 Type II certification?

SOC 2 Type II requires evidence that security controls operate effectively over a 6-12 month observation period. Testing must validate: (1) **Security**: Access controls, encryption, monitoring, incident response procedures; (2) **Availability**: System uptime, disaster recovery, backup testing; (3) **Processing Integrity**: Data validation, error handling, system monitoring; (4) **Confidentiality**: Data classification, access restrictions; (5) **Privacy**: If applicable, consent management, data retention, deletion procedures. We develop test plans aligned with your SOC 2 scope, execute control testing, document evidence for auditors, and track remediation of any control failures. Automated testing of security controls (access reviews, encryption validation, backup verification) reduces manual effort and ensures continuous compliance.

### How do we test for ADA website accessibility compliance?

ADA digital accessibility testing combines automated and manual approaches against WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (the de facto ADA benchmark). Testing includes: (1) **Automated scanning** using Axe, WAVE, Lighthouse catching 30-40% of issues (alt text, heading structure, color contrast, ARIA usage); (2) **Keyboard navigation testing** ensuring all functionality accessible without mouse; (3) **Screen reader testing** with JAWS (most popular in US), NVDA, VoiceOver validating meaningful experience for blind users; (4) **Manual inspection** for cognitive accessibility, focus management, form labels, error identification. Common violations: missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, keyboard traps, unlabeled form fields, inaccessible PDFs. We provide detailed WCAG conformance reports and remediation guidance. Ongoing monitoring prevents regression as new features are added.

### What's involved in FDA software validation for medical devices?

FDA software validation for medical devices follows risk-based approach per 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation) and guidance documents. Process includes: (1) **Software Development Plan** documenting lifecycle, risk management (ISO 14971), and verification/validation approach; (2) **Software Requirements Specification** defining functional and performance requirements; (3) **Risk Analysis** identifying hazards and mitigation measures (FMEA); (4) **Design Verification** confirming software meets specifications; (5) **Design Validation** ensuring software meets user needs and intended use. We execute IQ/OQ/PQ protocols, perform traceability matrix linking requirements to tests, and maintain Design History File (DHF) for FDA inspections. Testing intensity scales with device classification: Class III (life-sustaining devices) requires most rigorous validation. Cybersecurity testing per FDA premarket guidance increasingly important.

### How much does test automation reduce long-term QA costs?

Test automation typically reduces regression testing costs by 60-80% after initial investment. Economics: **Initial Investment**: $75,000-200,000 for framework setup, initial test development (3-6 months). **Maintenance**: 20-30% of test development cost annually for updates as application changes. **ROI Timeline**: Break-even typically occurs after 3-5 regression cycles, usually within 12-18 months. **Example**: Manual regression testing requiring 400 hours/cycle ($40,000 at $100/hour) can be automated to 80 hours ($8,000), saving $32,000 per cycle. With monthly releases, annual savings reach $384,000 vs. automation maintenance of $50,000. Best ROI for: stable applications with frequent releases, regression-heavy testing, and long product lifespans. Lower ROI for: rapidly changing UI, infrequent releases, short-term projects.

### What performance testing is required for e-commerce sites during peak seasons?

E-commerce performance testing for Black Friday/Cyber Monday requires simulating extreme traffic: **Load Profile**: 10-50x normal traffic during peak hours (typically 8pm-12am ET on Black Friday). Test scenarios include: (1) **Browse traffic**: Product browsing, search, filtering (70% of load); (2) **Cart operations**: Add to cart, cart updates (20%); (3) **Checkout**: Payment processing (10%). **Geographic distribution**: 40% East Coast, 35% West Coast, 25% Central US. **Testing phases**: (a) Baseline testing at normal load, (b) Load testing at 2-3x expected peak, (c) Stress testing to breaking point, (d) Soak testing for 4-8 hours validating stability. **Key metrics**: Response time <2 seconds, transaction success rate >99.5%, third-party integrations (payment gateways, inventory) performance. Testing should occur 4-6 weeks before peak season allowing time for optimization. Cloud auto-scaling configuration tested and validated.

### What's the difference between SAST and DAST security testing?

**SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** analyzes source code without executing it, identifying vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), hardcoded credentials, and insecure cryptography. **Advantages**: Early detection during development, comprehensive code coverage, identifies exact vulnerable code location. **Limitations**: False positives (20-40% typical), misses runtime and configuration issues, requires access to source code. **Tools**: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** tests running applications by simulating attacks without source code access. **Advantages**: No false positives (if vulnerability found, it's real), tests actual runtime behavior, works on any application (black-box). **Limitations**: Later in SDLC, incomplete code coverage, doesn't identify vulnerable code location. **Tools**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Acunetix. **Best practice**: Use both—SAST during development (shift-left security), DAST before production deployment. Combined approach catches 70-80% of vulnerabilities vs. 40-50% for either alone.

### Which US cities have the strongest QA and DevOps talent pools?

Top US markets for QA and DevOps talent: **San Francisco Bay Area** leads in DevOps, cloud-native testing, and test automation with concentration of technology companies and highest salaries ($120,000-200,000 for senior roles). **Seattle** strong in cloud platform expertise (AWS proximity), e-commerce testing (Amazon influence), and DevOps practices ($110,000-180,000). **Austin** emerging as cost-effective alternative with growing tech sector, strong university talent pipeline (UT Austin), and established enterprise presence ($90,000-150,000). **New York City** deep financial services testing expertise, compliance testing, and traditional QA ($100,000-170,000). **Boston** healthcare testing, academic talent from MIT/Harvard, and biotech QA expertise. **Research Triangle NC** cost-effective with strong technical talent and lower cost of living. Remote work has expanded talent access—many organizations adopt hybrid models with core team in major hub and remote team members nationwide. Regulatory testing (FDA, HIPAA) still benefits from proximity to clients.
