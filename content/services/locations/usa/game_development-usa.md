## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does it cost to develop a mobile game?

Mobile game development costs vary enormously based on scope, quality, and platform. Hyper-casual games cost $15,000-$75,000 for simple mechanics, basic 2D art, and minimal backend. Casual games (match-3, word games, simple puzzles) cost $75,000-$250,000 for polished 2D graphics, progression systems, and basic monetization. Mid-core games (strategy, RPG, multiplayer) cost $250,000-$2,000,000 for 3D graphics, complex systems, backend infrastructure, and live ops. AAA mobile games cost $2,000,000-$10,000,000+ for console-quality graphics and extensive content. These ranges assume professional development; solo developers can reduce costs through sweat equity while corporate development with high overhead increases costs.

### How long does game development take?

Development timelines correlate with scope and budget. Hyper-casual prototypes reach market in 6-12 weeks. Casual mobile games require 3-6 months. Mid-core mobile games need 8-18 months. Indie console/PC games take 12-36 months. AA console games require 18-30 months. AAA titles need 24-60 months with some franchises in continuous development across releases. These timelines assume proper scoping and stable teams; understaffing, scope creep, or technical challenges extend schedules. We recommend adding 20-30% time buffer for unforeseen issues, especially for first-time teams or new IP development.

### What platforms should we target for launch?

Platform selection depends on genre, target audience, and resources. Mobile games should typically launch on both iOS and Android simultaneously using cross-platform engines (Unity, Unreal) unless technical limitations or market testing suggest sequential launch. Console games increasingly launch across PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch simultaneously maximizing market reach, though platform exclusivity deals (Sony, Microsoft, Epic) provide funding in exchange for limited availability. PC games should target Steam primarily with Epic Games Store for exclusivity deals or broader distribution. Consider starting narrower (iOS only, PC only) for initial market testing, then expanding based on success.

### How do free-to-play games make money?

Free-to-play monetization combines multiple revenue streams. In-app purchases generate 80-90% of mobile game revenue through consumables (currency, boosters, lives), cosmetics (skins, characters), progression accelerators (XP boosts, time skips), and subscriptions (battle passes, VIP status). Advertising provides 10-20% of revenue through rewarded video (players watch ads for in-game rewards), interstitial ads (full-screen between levels), and banner ads. Effective F2P games convert 2-5% of players to paying users generating $20-100+ per paying user annually (ARPPU) while free players provide network effects, community, and ad revenue. Balancing monetization with player experience determines long-term success.

### What's the difference between Unity and Unreal Engine?

Unity excels for mobile, indie, and cross-platform development with gentler learning curve, C# programming (more accessible than C++), massive asset store, lower hardware requirements, better 2D support, and broader platform support (WebGL, mobile, console, VR/AR). Unreal provides AAA graphics quality, powerful Blueprint visual scripting, cutting-edge rendering, better out-of-box visual quality, strong console/PC optimization, and generous revenue terms (5% after $1 million vs. Unity's subscription model). Choose Unity for mobile-first, rapid prototyping, 2D games, or teams without strong C++ skills. Choose Unreal for graphics-focused, console/PC titles, realistic visuals, or teams with technical art expertise.

### How important are game ratings (ESRB) in USA?

ESRB ratings significantly impact distribution and market reach. Console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo) require ESRB ratings for physical distribution and strongly encourage for digital. Major retailers (GameStop, Walmart, Target) require ESRB ratings for shelf placement. Parents use ESRB ratings for purchase decisions. Mobile platforms (App Store, Google Play) use their own age rating systems but ESRB provides consistency. Ratings affect marketing as ads targeting specific age groups must match content ratings. "M" rated games face marketing restrictions limiting TV advertising and requiring age-gated digital ads. Budget $3,000-$10,000 for ESRB rating process depending on content volume (full game certification vs. digital-only short form).

### Should we develop games in-house or outsource?

This decision depends on core competency, budget, and long-term strategy. Develop in-house when game development represents core business, you're building long-term IP, you need complete creative control, you have or can build required expertise, and you plan multiple game releases building team expertise. Outsource when you're entering gaming from other industry (entertainment, education, marketing), you're validating concept before commitment, you lack game development expertise, you need faster time to market, or you're budget-constrained. Hybrid approaches work well: in-house design and direction with outsourced art, audio, or specific technical components. Many successful studios started outsourced, validated concepts, then brought development in-house for subsequent titles.
