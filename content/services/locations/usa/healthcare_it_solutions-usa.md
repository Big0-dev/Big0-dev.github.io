## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does HIPAA compliance require for healthcare software?

HIPAA compliance requires comprehensive security and privacy controls for protected health information (PHI). Technical safeguards include: (1) **Access Controls**: Unique user IDs, automatic logoff, encryption/decryption mechanisms, and emergency access procedures; (2) **Audit Controls**: Comprehensive logging of PHI access, modifications, and disclosures with tamper-proof audit trails; (3) **Integrity Controls**: Ensuring PHI isn't improperly altered or destroyed; (4) **Transmission Security**: Encryption of PHI in transit (TLS 1.2+, AES-256). Administrative safeguards: Security Officer designation, workforce training, risk analysis, and incident response procedures. Physical safeguards: facility access controls and workstation security. All vendors handling PHI require Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)—ensure cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) sign HIPAA BAAs. Annual security risk assessments required. OCR (Office for Civil Rights) violations result in $100-1.5M fines per violation category.

### How do I integrate with Epic or Cerner EHR systems?

**Epic Integration**: (1) **Epic App Orchard**: Submit third-party applications for Epic marketplace requiring Epic review and approval; (2) **Epic APIs**: Use FHIR APIs for patient data access following SMART on FHIR standards, or Epic Interconnect APIs for system-to-system integration; (3) **HL7 Interfaces**: Traditional HL7 v2 messaging (ADT, ORM, ORU) for patient demographics, orders, and results; (4) **Epic Training**: Developers typically need Epic proficiency training ($5,000-15,000 per person). **Cerner Integration**: (1) **Cerner FHIR APIs**: OAuth 2.0 secured APIs for patient data; (2) **CCL (Cerner Command Language)**: Direct database queries for reporting; (3) **HL7 Interfaces**: Standard messaging integration. Both require coordination with health system IT departments, security reviews, and BAAs. Timeline: 3-9 months from initial discussions to production depending on complexity. Costs: $50,000-500,000+ for comprehensive integration depending on scope.

### What are the requirements for FDA-regulated medical device software?

FDA Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) requirements depend on risk classification. **Class I** (low risk): General controls, usually exempt from premarket review. **Class II** (moderate risk): 510(k) premarket notification demonstrating substantial equivalence to predicate device ($5,000 FDA fee, $100,000-300,000 total cost, 3-12 months). **Class III** (high risk): Premarket Approval (PMA) with clinical trials ($300,000+ FDA fee, millions total, years timeline). Development must follow: (1) **21 CFR Part 820** Quality System Regulation with design controls; (2) **IEC 62304** software lifecycle; (3) **Risk management** per ISO 14971; (4) **Software V&V** with Installation/Operational/Performance Qualification; (5) **Cybersecurity** per FDA guidance including threat modeling and SBOM; (6) **Design History File** documenting entire development. Maintain Quality Management System (QMS) and prepare for FDA inspections.

### How does the 21st Century Cures Act affect healthcare IT development?

21st Century Cures Act Final Rule (effective 2020-2022 phased implementation) prohibits information blocking and mandates patient data access. Requirements: (1) **No Information Blocking**: Healthcare providers and IT developers cannot interfere with access, exchange, or use of electronic health information—exceptions exist for privacy, security, preventing harm, but burden of proof is high. Violations result in significant penalties; (2) **FHIR APIs Required**: Health IT developers must publish APIs using HL7 FHIR R4 standard with USCDI data elements for patient access without special effort; (3) **USCDI Support**: Support for United States Core Data for Interoperability (currently v3) including demographics, medications, problems, procedures, immunizations, lab results, clinical notes, provenance; (4) **SMART on FHIR**: Enable third-party app authorization using SMART on FHIR protocols. Impact: Patients can access complete medical records via apps, enables innovation in patient-facing health apps, requires ongoing API maintenance as USCDI expands annually.

### What's required for HIPAA-compliant telehealth platforms?

HIPAA-compliant telehealth requires: (1) **Video Conferencing**: HIPAA-compliant platforms with signed BAAs (Zoom for Healthcare, Doxy.me, VSee)—consumer platforms like standard Zoom, Skype, FaceTime not HIPAA-compliant without BAA; (2) **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for video, audio, and chat; (3) **Access Controls**: Password protection, waiting rooms, meeting locks preventing unauthorized access; (4) **PHI Minimization**: Don't display PHI in meeting names, use unique meeting IDs not personal IDs; (5) **Recording Compliance**: If recording sessions, obtain patient authorization and store recordings securely with encryption. State licensure critical—providers must be licensed in patient's physical location state during telemedicine visit. DEA requirements for prescribing controlled substances—Ryan Haight Act generally requires in-person visit before prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine (COVID-19 exceptions expired). Medicare telehealth reimbursement follows specific requirements (patient location, originating site, eligible services). Costs: HIPAA-compliant platforms $20-50 per provider/month.

### How do Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement work for health IT?

Medicare reimbursement for digital health services: (1) **Telehealth**: Medicare pays for telehealth services (95+ CPT codes) including E/M visits, therapy, consultations. Geographic restrictions (patient in rural area) lifted during COVID public health emergency but some restrictions returning; (2) **Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)**: CPT 99453 (device setup), 99454 (device supply), 99457 (first 20 minutes monitoring), 99458 (additional 20 minutes). Requires 16 days of data per month. Typical reimbursement $50-100 per patient per month; (3) **Chronic Care Management (CCM)**: CPT 99490 (first 20 minutes), 99439 (additional 20 minutes) for comprehensive care management. Requires certified EHR, 24/7 access, care plan. Reimbursement ~$42-84 per patient per month; (4) **Principal Care Management (PCM)**: Similar to CCM but for single chronic condition. Medicaid varies by state—some states offer robust telehealth coverage, others minimal. Prior authorization often required for Medicaid. Health IT must support proper documentation, billing codes, and integration with claims systems for reimbursement.

### Which US regions have the strongest healthcare IT talent and resources?

Premier healthcare IT talent markets: **Boston** leads with academic medical centers (Mass General Brigham, Beth Israel), biotech/pharma concentration, and universities (MIT, Harvard) providing talent pipeline ($130,000-220,000 for senior health IT developers). **Silicon Valley/San Francisco** dominates digital health innovation with venture capital, Apple/Google health initiatives, and consumer health tech ($150,000-250,000, highest costs). **Nashville** offers healthcare IT concentration with HCA, CHS, and health IT companies at lower costs than coasts ($100,000-170,000). **Cleveland** provides academic medical center expertise (Cleveland Clinic) with Midwest costs. **Research Triangle NC** combines Duke/UNC health systems, clinical research, and cost-effectiveness ($95,000-160,000). **Seattle** offers Fred Hutchinson, UW Medicine, and Microsoft health initiatives. For HIPAA-compliant development, consider whether offshore development is acceptable (requires BAAs with offshore vendors, data residency concerns)—many healthcare organizations restrict development to US-based teams. Epic/Cerner expertise concentrated near large health systems using these platforms.
