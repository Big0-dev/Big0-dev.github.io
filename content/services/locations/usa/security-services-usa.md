## Frequently Asked Questions

### What cybersecurity regulations apply to my US-based business?

Cybersecurity regulations in the USA depend on your industry and state location. Federal regulations include HIPAA for healthcare, GLBA for financial services, and FTC Act Section 5 prohibiting unfair/deceptive practices. State laws include California's CCPA/CPRA, Virginia's VCDPA, and 50+ breach notification laws. Public companies must comply with SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules (effective 2024). Critical infrastructure sectors face additional requirements from CISA, TSA, NERC, and other agencies. We assess your specific regulatory obligations during initial consultation.

### How long does SOC 2 Type II certification take?

SOC 2 Type II certification typically requires 6-12 months in the USA. This includes 3-4 months for control implementation and documentation, followed by a 6-month observation period during which auditors verify controls operate effectively over time. SOC 2 Type I (point-in-time) can be completed in 3-4 months but provides less assurance to customers. Most US SaaS companies pursue Type II for competitive differentiation and enterprise sales requirements. We can accelerate timelines for organizations with existing security programs.

### What is CMMC and do I need it as a defense contractor?

Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is required for Department of Defense contractors handling Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). CMMC has three levels: Level 1 for basic cybersecurity hygiene, Level 2 for CUI protection (based on NIST SP 800-171's 110 controls), and Level 3 for advanced persistent threats. Requirements phase in through 2026 with third-party assessments. If your contracts involve CUI (technical data, blueprints, etc.), you'll need CMMC Level 2 minimum. We provide gap assessments and implementation support.

### How do state breach notification laws work across multiple states?

When a data breach affects residents of multiple US states, you must comply with each state's notification law. Requirements vary significantly: California requires notification "without unreasonable delay," Florida mandates 30 days, Colorado allows 30 days, while others specify "most expeditious time possible." Some states require attorney general notification (e.g., New York, Massachusetts), credit bureau notification for large breaches (1,000+ residents in many states), and specific content requirements. We provide multi-state breach response services coordinating all notifications and regulatory filings.

### What's the difference between FedRAMP and FISMA compliance?

FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) applies to federal agencies and their information systems, requiring compliance with NIST SP 800-53 controls and Risk Management Framework (RMF). FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) applies to cloud service providers serving federal agencies, using the same NIST controls but with standardized baselines and third-party assessment. FedRAMP provides a "do once, use many times" framework so cloud providers don't undergo separate security reviews for each agency. If you're a cloud vendor serving government, you need FedRAMP; if you're an agency, you follow FISMA.

### How much do cybersecurity services cost in the USA?

US cybersecurity service costs vary by scope and complexity. Penetration testing ranges from $15,000-50,000 for web applications to $50,000-150,000+ for comprehensive network and cloud assessments. SOC 2 certification projects typically cost $75,000-200,000 including implementation, audit preparation, and first audit. FedRAMP authorization ranges from $250,000-1,000,000+ depending on baseline level. Managed SOC services run $10,000-50,000 monthly based on environment size. vCISO services range from $8,000-25,000 monthly. We provide detailed proposals after initial assessment.

### Which US cities have the strongest cybersecurity talent pools?

The strongest US cybersecurity talent concentrations are in Washington DC metro area (government contractors, agencies, cleared personnel), San Francisco Bay Area (Silicon Valley technology companies, security startups), New York City (financial services, consulting firms), Austin (growing tech sector, Dell/IBM heritage), Boston (academic institutions, healthcare), Seattle (Amazon, Microsoft), and Research Triangle NC (government, universities). We maintain security teams across these regions and can staff projects nationwide. Remote work has expanded talent access, but certain roles (federal contracts, on-site assessments) require local presence.
