Simple apps can be completed in 2-3 months, while complex apps with advanced features require 4-8 months. Timeline depends on features, platforms, integrations, and design complexity. We provide detailed project schedules upfront.

Yes, we manage the complete app store submission process including metadata optimization, screenshot creation, compliance review, and addressing any rejection issues. We have a 95% first-time approval rate.

### What ongoing maintenance and updates do you provide?

We offer comprehensive maintenance packages including bug fixes, OS updates, security patches, performance optimization, feature enhancements, and analytics monitoring to keep your app current and competitive.
