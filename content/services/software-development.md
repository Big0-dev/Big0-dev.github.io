faqs:
  - q: "How long does a typical project take?"
    a: "An MVP ships in 8-12 weeks. Full platforms take 4-9 months. You see working
      software every two weeks, so you're never in the dark about progress."
  - q: "Can you integrate AI into our existing software?"
    a: "Yes — it's one of our strengths. We embed document intelligence, automated
      workflows, and smart features into new and existing applications. The AI works
      inside your software, not as a separate tool your team has to learn."
  - q: "What happens if requirements change mid-project?"
    a: "They always do. We work in 2-week sprints specifically so we can adapt.
      Changing direction in week 6 is easy. Changing direction in month 12 of a
      waterfall project is expensive. That's why we build this way."
  - q: "Do you provide ongoing maintenance?"
    a: "Yes. Bug fixes, security updates, performance optimization, and feature
      enhancements. We build it, we stand behind it."
  - q: "How do you handle sensitive data and compliance?"
    a: "We build for regulated industries — healthcare, finance, legal. GDPR, data
      encryption, audit trails, and role-based access are part of our standard
      approach, not add-ons."
