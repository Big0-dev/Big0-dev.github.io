challenge: "You have a product idea and customers waiting, but no engineering team.
  Hiring takes months. Agencies give you a project manager instead of engineers. You
  need senior developers who can make technical decisions and ship working software —
  starting now."

faqs:
  - q: "How is this different from hiring an agency?"
    a: "You talk directly to senior engineers, not project managers. Our CEO writes
      code. Our CTO reviews every PR. You get the same people from kickoff to launch —
      no rotation, no handoffs to juniors."
  - q: "Can you help with hardware products?"
    a: "Yes. We've shipped physical products — drones, IoT devices, embedded systems.
      Mechanical design, PCB engineering, firmware, and cloud connectivity. We published
      our flight control research in IEEE."
  - q: "What happens when I hire my own team?"
    a: "That's the goal. We write clean, well-documented code and establish engineering
      practices so your future team can take over smoothly. We'll even help you hire
      and onboard them."
  - q: "How fast can you start?"
    a: "Typically within a week. We're a small team — no procurement process, no
      legal department to go through. We scope the work, agree on terms, and start
      building."
  - q: "What's your tech stack?"
    a: "We pick the right tools for your product, not our favorite framework. Python,
      TypeScript, React, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS — we're experienced across the modern
      stack. For hardware: SolidWorks, Altium, STM32, ESP32."

  actually build it — not a sales team."
